When entering strings, the only time you are required to use curly brackets, is when entering multi-line strings, but you can use them at any time, short or long. Attempting to use quotes on creating a multi-line string will result in a syntax error.

you need to have rebol.exe somewhere in a place, that it can run from anywhere

drag "print.r" to "rebol2bat.bat" don't care about anything.
You'll get print.bat, that just runs from everywhere (you drag any file onto "print.bat" no "print.r" needed any more!)

follow the rules:

arg: to-string system/options/args
replace/all arg "\" "/"
replace/all arg ":" ""
filen: last parse/all arg {/}
path: to-file join "/" replace arg filen ""
system/options/path: path
system/script/path: path
system/script/parent/path: path

makes it possible for you to get the arguments (usualy files) by drag them onto the bat-file

I am trying to display a new set of images after the user presses a button. The first part of the script sets a count, assigns the file path to the images to be displayed (which is done randomly within a set of options) and draws the window. This happens as expected the first time around. The button in question calls a function that re-assigns the images and then requests to show the new set of images. I know that the assignment is done properly but the window is not updated. What am I missing?

This is the code in question:

view gui: layout [

    backdrop white
    text font-size 15 "Set of pictures”
    below
    text join "Photo's clicked: " count
    across
    button 148x135 my-pict1 [ count: count + 1 ]

    show [a b c d]

this will change your button's picture.

either (action = bad) [
^-misses: misses + 1
^-hits: hits - 1
^-x/text: join "Score: " hits

The time has come for REBOL to be released as open source. This is the only way I can see it regaining some degree of momentum and renewed interest -- not just within our REBOL community, but for many yet-to-be users who possess the curiosity or motivation to learn new and powerful programming concepts and techniques.
Here's my proposal

    The R3 source code will be released under GPL 2 (most likely - still open to discussion.)
    The official source release distribution (rel-src) will be made available from the REBOL.com site.
    Developmental sources (dev-src) will be available on GitHub (or a similar service.)
    From time to time the dev-src will be reviewed, selected, debugged, polished, and integrated into rel-src releases.
    A small group of REBOL Masters (maybe three for now) will be in charge of such rel-src review, selection, revising, debugging, integration etc. as well as develop or encourage the development of new features, ports to new platforms, optimizations, etc.
    My role will be to advise and guide such decisions to keep REBOL consistent with its principles, and I will hold the final power of veto, in cases where that becomes necessary.

What I ask in return

If this proposal seems acceptable, there's one thing I ask in return. That those of you who wish to influence and extend the design of REBOL do so with a full understanding of its principles. REBOL is not like other languages, and you will soon discover that REBOL source is not like other source. Architecture and design are important.

Although it is unrealistic to assume we can filter/fix all impurities that might come about in an open environment, we should all strive to minimize the degradation that comes about by seeking an easy solution over the proper and well designed form of such a solution. Even the naming of each symbol, function, and datatype is worthy of thoughtful consideration. That is how I've always treated it.

In the end a language or system should help developers make their programming tasks easier and their products more timely, affordable, manageable, and agile. Too often, it becomes the opposite. Let's always keep that in mind.
What's next?

So... this is it. Once R3 is released our course becomes irreversible. We'll all start paddling our canoes like mad in a small but rapid river... but one which I sincerely hope will carry us to a much larger ocean.

Please offer your comments and advice on any of the above. This is the final call. If you posted a comment on the prior blog that you want me to review again, please note its date and time. I'll go back and take a look.

That should be easy to manage and would provide for a very dynamic collection of topics.

Perhaps at least one tag should be compulsory for new topics, with them being optional in the comments. Plus the moderator/s at least should be able to add or edit the tags at a later date.

 Just discovering Rebol and i try this below:
factorial: func [n]  [either n > 1 [n * factorial (n - 1)] [1]]
print factorial (3)
print factorial (2)
print factorial (3) * factorial (2)

The output is 
6 (OK)
2 (OK)
720 (wrong?????)
What i am doing wrong?} "Gérard" "29-Nov-2012/6:14:33-8:00" {Evaluation in REBOL is left to right, but <i>infix operations take precedence over prefix operations</i>.  

The "*" symbol takes two values, so your code is evaluated as:

factorial (3 * (factorial 2))
factorial (3 * 2)
factorial 6
720

Use parentheses to force precedence:

>> factorial 2 + 1 * 2
== 720
>> factorial (2 + 1) * 2
== 720
>> factorial 2 + (1 * 2)
== 24
>> (factorial 2 + 1) * 2
== 12

So the code you want is:

print (factorial 3) * (factorial 2)
or
print (factorial 3) * factorial 2      ; second parens not required

(factorial 3) * (factorial 2)
6 * 2
12

To add some more clarification, all infix operators have prefix versions:

(2 * 2) = (* 2 2)

So, another way to write your intended expression could be:

print * factorial 3 factorial 2 

Be sure to look at the source:

source *

*: native [
    "Returns the first value multiplied by the second."
    value1 [number! pair! char! money! time! tuple!]
    value2 [number! pair! char! money! time! tuple!]
]

The prefix version is * value1 value2
The infix version is value1 * value2   <- (VALUE1 * VALUE2) WILL BE COMPUTED
                                          _BEFORE_ THE REST OF A SURROUNDING

Well, this is very easy for sure:

Here is a better way:
    r: loop 10 [append [] random 10]

Or even:
    r: loop 3 [loop 5 [append [] random 10]]

As you can see [] is initialized just once and used for whole life cycle of the loops. This is an example of how Rebol aggressively use series!.

Or even better:
loop 3 [loop 5 [append r: [] random 10]]

Why this is better? Because, your loops can do something and return something else while filling up r.

Here is an example:
    loop 3 [loop 5 [append r: [] random 10] print "."]

This won't work if you do:
r: loop 3 [loop 5 [append [] random 10] print "."]

You shouldn't use quotes in a file type.  You can use either of these to refer to the file:

to-file "/C/Users/Robert Wiggins/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/CFSWW1 Over Flanders Fields/CFS3.xca"

I have one more ? I want to copy a file from one location on a disk to another location. I'm not sure if I should be using "Read" and "Write" to do this. I just want to do a sort of backup of a file. Any recommendations?? Thanks} "Robert Wiggins" "24-Dec-2012/9:27:06-8:00" {Hi Robert,

You can do:

write %backup.fil read %source.fil

or, if it's a binary file:
