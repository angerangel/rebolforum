[{Redirect a windows command line program to a GUI field} {Is is possible to do the above. I'm still working on my GUI and I want to see, in real time, the output of my command line program just as you would see in a dos command window, but show it on my GUI somehow. I assume a field would be where it could display??} "tony" "18-Jan-2012/22:19:34-8:00" {Well, you will run into challenges long before getting to the GUI part. I would focus on trying this in the REBOL console first.

It would mean saving the output of the command line program to disk and poll on that file once in a while, by opening a port to the file and copy from it. This would run in a loop with a small WAIT to avoid too much CPU usage.

You can't do this with CALL, if that is what you were expecting.

I'd suggest reading up on ports:

Curly brackets are used for strings of more than 50 characters and for multi-line strings.

There is no internal difference between them and you can ignore this, when probing strings. They are the same type: string!.

When entering strings, the only time you are required to use curly brackets, is when entering multi-line strings, but you can use them at any time, short or long. Attempting to use quotes on creating a multi-line string will result in a syntax error.

When using curly brackets, you also no longer have to escape quotes and can type:

{"}

  Yes, that probably the reason I'm getting the curly brackets when I select a file name longer than 50 characters, but how do I change them back to quotes, as you can see in my script when the movie.avs file is written, rebol uses the curly brackets around the filepath which an external application will access.
