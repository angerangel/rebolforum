The record format for file 1 is fixed; example
"201185241008524100ENVIR SERVICES EXECUTIVE      1000SP01A2" and 
201185242118524211PERMIT SUPPORT SERVICES DIV   1000SP01A2"

The record format for file 2 is :"852421120100701BUD DEV-HAZ WASZTE SITE CLEANUP"

I need to read the file top get only those with the first 4 of "2011" and the last 2 of "A2".
Then I need to compare user the next 7 characters, which is the cost center, and match with another file to compare the text and output differences.

I think I've got how to read the file and search thru another file for matches, but how do I split/parse file 1 into segments I can use?

I don't seem to "get it."  Thanks!!

Generally you want to ensure you end with a QUIT (rather than a HALT or a console error).

Easy way to make (almost!) certain of that is to:

1. ensure HALT can't happen by accident:
    halt: :quit

2. wrap all the code in an attempt:
   attempt [--all the cgi code--]
   quit

Your function needs to be bound to some context in order to evaluate words. You can either do that when the function is built, or you can re-bind the body of the function dynamically (or specific words as Nick showed).

There is no right or wrong, just tradeoffs. If you're creating millions of objects, shared functions may be the way to go. If you're making millions of calls against a func, the extra binding overhead may be an issue.

You may also need to consider scenarios like recursive functions, closure/local-series issues, etc.} "Gregg Irwin" "20-May-2010/14:59:19-7:00" {Thanks Gregg, I understand. I just want to learn more about binding.

A little tweaking is necessary though. 

First, you need to open the bundle, look for any hard coded path to the rebol.exe and make it fit your need.

Second, in order to get syntax highlighting, you need to add your own elements to any particular theme, and make sure the "Selector" will match their particular definitions in the bundle.

Lastly, the word completion is available by pressing the Esc key. That's a little weird choice, I prefer CTRL-space.

I'd like to announce important milestone in my personal(occasional weekend hobby ;)) JITteR project developement that has just been achieved yesterday.

JITteR is lightweight REBOL dialect that enables running JIT compiled functions directly from REBOL interpreter.
Such JIT compiled functions can be tens to hundreds times faster than REBOL equivalent code.
Usage of JITter is aimed on graphics routines, compressors, codecs, generators, number crunching algorithms and various other time-critical programming tasks.
The main idea of this project is not to clone all REBOL functionality but maintain compatibility in sense of JITteR -> REBOL way so any code written in JITteR can be executed(fallback) as plain REBOL function! without the need of touching the code.

Currently only REBOL2 version is being tested and x86 CPUs are supported. But R3 and other CPUs will be added in later stages of the developement.
Licensing is not yet decided (until the project reach full Alpha stage). But the code will be definitely free for non-commercial usage.

Since this release is only 'internal' I hope this announces doesn't sound to much 'vaporwarish' :-)

Alpha release is planned to be released to closed group of developers in ~2 months.
Feel free to leave any feedback in the Ann-Reply group or PM me.

project features log:

JITteR v0.1.23.3.1 (pre-Alpha version internal release) - 16-May-2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- currently only x86 32-bit CPU assembly supported (other CPUs planned in Beta stage)
- datatype support: image!, binary!, string!, integer!, decimal!, char!, logic! 
- path! lookup support on binary!, image!, string! byte arrays
- math operations: +,-,*,/,<,>,<=,>=,=
- boolean operations: NOT, AND, OR, XOR
- parens support: REBOL-like code evaluation precedence
- supported keywords (REBOL compatible): APPLY(currently on JITTer functions only), LOOP, REPEAT, WHILE, UNTIL, BREAK, IF, EITHER, PICK, POKE

my biggest worry about Rebol is that its development is moving too slow, and not fast enough  filling in the gaps that are inherent in the language and its ecosystem,   and that its strengths will be copied by another programming language (existing or new one) where the community is more active and then there will be no reason for Rebol's existence.

there is no true Rebol IDE , or multithreading or abiity to call stored procedure. No major web framework like Rails or Grails, spring, struts , no compiler etc...

test:  func [ input /local s ] [ s: "hello"   append s input ]
>> test "joe"
== "hellojoe"
>> test "tom"
== "hellojoetom"

test "tom"  should give me "hello tom" 

I know we have to do "copy" to work around that problem, but this is a hack, it goes against the principle that your program should do exactly as we write. i.e if I have a statement s: "dear" in the body of my function,  every time you call the function , it should execute s:  "dear"  and assign "dear" to s.  

this brings an element of unpredictability to the outcome of our code, if the language can override what I want my code to do.

what does the community think about that?



} "yuem" "30-May-2010/9:31:54-7:00" {You know this is discussed several times, it always confusing beginners mind, as it was for me.
But "copy"ing is not a hack or workaround actually, it is a must.
When you think it is just a string, it look you are right. But it is a series actually.
And variables are always "point" to series in Rebol.
Otherwise when you do this:
b: [a b c]
b: next b
Then you will lost the original b, and you would have only [b c] as b.
or c: at b 3
c would be a new variable. it is so, but actually it is just points to another position inside b.
so b and c points to the same series.
equal? head b head c
>> true
It is all same for the strings and other series types.
And it is a way to use static variable in a function.

f: func [/local x] [x: [5] print first x change x (first x) + 1]
f
>> 5
f
>> 6
otherwise we would need a /static like /local.
But I agreed with you, it is confusing.} "Endo" "30-May-2010/9:52:39-7:00" {my point is that the statement s: "dear" should be executed every time my function is executed, even if it is a series, it should reinitialize the series.

example:

>> s: [ 1 ]
== [1]
>> append s  2
== [1 2]
>> s: [ 1 ]
== [1]
>>

the lines above are what I get from the rebol console

you see what I mean,  s should become 1 again , as it should execute the latest assignment again. it's not an append statement, it's an assignment. It doesn't matter whether it is a series or a string.


} "Yuem" "30-May-2010/10:05:39-7:00" {Yuem, in your particular case, that seems like a reasonable statement, but Endo is right.  Persistent series are essential to the way REBOL works, and that characteristic enables many other valuable features of the language.

So, it's not a hack. It's a basic REBOL design philosophy and it works even more aggressively in REBOL 3 and there is a function type to explicitly state what you want in your example.} "Henrik" "30-May-2010/15:17:41-7:00" {That's an interesting issue...

Since it has two drawing engines, it has also two separate font systems, one which does full anti-aliasing (DRAW) and one which does not (View), and it's the latter one you are looking for. Each engine has its own set of advantages and they don't overlap much, featurewise.
You will find that using DRAW to make text for buttons is quite hard, since DRAW doesn't use any font metrics, so you can for example, center the text properly. To do that, requires jumping through some hoops and perform some hacks and it eats memory and performance and it won't always work, so overall, getting anti-aliased text in your GUI is perhaps not worth the effort.

This is not a good design and thus in REBOL 3, only the DRAW engine is available, while bringing in features from the old View engine, such as proper text centering and simple metrics. Furthermore it adds proper rich text and soft shadows.

There is not a good chance that this will also be done for REBOL 2. It would be too much work.

But it won't be loaded if you execute your script from inside a text editor (like Editplus). So when you halt the execution you won't be able to use those functions in your user.r file.
Here is the solution I've found:

-i --secure allow --do "do join first split-path system/options/boot %user.r" --script "$(FilePath)"

-i is for "no install" for view & link only. 
Note that the --do "..." part. You can change it to any file you want to be loaded when you execute a file.

And I tested only with this simple websocket chat server:

run the chat server, it uses port 8181, so open that port on your firewall. start this script type;

it should connect to the server
and start the script again connect to the server.

try 'insert p "hello"' from one client, on the other one, 'pick p 1' it should receive the message.

3 Fills 2 text fields
4 Clicks the Get Table button
5 Waits for the requested data
6 Captures the numeric data just behind "High:" into a variable
7 Captures the numeric data just behind "High:" into a second variable.

Do you think this is possible with Rebol 2 or 3?
Any hint would be welcomed.

Cheers

Francisco} "Francisco" "24-Aug-2010/7:30:56-7:00" {Hi, Rebol can do this very easily,
You need to POST your data like below (note that I'm too lazy to do all the job, just get the idea)

t: read/custom http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates [POST "exch2=usd&date1=06/07/08&date=09/07/08&..."]

add any other form elements in ..., t will hold the server response.
then parse the t. here is an example of parse:

t: {
    <TR> 
     <TD>BGCOLOR="#DFDFDF"><FONT FACE="Verdana" size="2">  High:<FONT></TD>
     <TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF"><FONT FACE="Verdana" size="2"> 0.79060 </FONT></TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
     <TD BGCOLOR="#DFDFDF"><FONT FACE="Verdana" size="2">  Low:</FONT></TD>
     <TD BGCOLOR="#EFEFEF"><FONT FACE="Verdana" size="2"> 0.77410 </FONT></TD>
    <TR>
}

>> parse/all t [some [thru {< FONT FACE="Verdana" size="2" >} copy v to {<} (print v) ]]

Please could you post the part of the string that clicks the "Get Table" button?

Francisco} "Francisco" "24-Aug-2010/9:11:52-7:00" {Hi, I don't simulate the clicking of Get Table button, instead, I send an http request & get the result.
Open the page and look at its source, you'll see the < form ...> and other form elements like < input name=date1 ...> so you can get the necessary names of form elements and fill them in your request:

t: read/custom http://example.com [POST {date1="010203"&currency="usd"}] ;etc..

so, your request goes to server and t will hold the server response, then you can parse the t.

For what you want to do with parse, it's really not too complex.  To extract strings from a larger block of text, using start and end search strings, memorize this syntax:

parse (your-text-block) [
    any [thru {start} copy variable to {end} (actions with variable)] to end
]

Here's an example from http://re-bol.com/examples.txt :

R E B O L []
code: {
    view layout [
        btn {some text}
        btn {some more text}
    ] 
}
strings: copy []
parse code [
    any [thru "{" copy a-string to "}" (append strings a-string)] to end
]
foreach str strings [
    if true = request rejoin [{Change "} str {"?}] [
        replace/all code str request-text/title rejoin [
            {Change "} str {" to:}

    ]

For Firefox 3.5.6, I unzipped those same files to:

i am a complete newbie, not only with rebol but with programming generally. But i wanted a simple GUI that helps me convert my DVD collection and i read somewhere that rebol is easy to use. So i have been working with it since yesterday and my GUI actually already does some of the things necessary.
But now the first problem: How do i insert text that includes "" in a field or area?
For example: field "he said "i love it"" won't work because anything after "he said " will be ignored.

Thanks in advance for your help.} "Rob" "6-Sep-2010/12:31:05-7:00" {{he said "i love it"}} "Graham" "6-Sep-2010/16:53:35-7:00" {Hi Rob,

Just to complete the possibilities, you can also put single quotes inside double quotes:

    "he said 'i love it'"

I use curly braces most of the time in REBOL because it's easier to see where they start and end, and curly braces can also be placed inside strings delimited by curly braces:

    >> print {hello {quotes}}
    hello {quotes}

Next problem: Probably best to explain first what i'm trying to do: I want my GUI to save two files for me that will be used to encode DVDs. And the text in these files is what i am trying to create with the GUI. I am using several fields and the values of the fields are determined by radio buttons. And then, and here is the next problem, i also want the values selected by the radio buttons to be inserted into the text in an area. For example: I have a field called hor, i select "640" by radio button as value for this field.
Now in an area i have Lanczos4Resize(xxx,yyy) as text and i want the selected value 640 to replace the xxx. How do i do this? } "Rob" "7-Sep-2010/8:49:08-7:00" {Is this what you're hoping for?

The layout block is written in the VID dialect, and a dialect is a sublanguage, which doesn't necessarily use the same words and syntax as what normally write. It only works inside that block. That's why you get:

because that is interpreted incorrectly by the LAYOUT function.

Write the PIECEBLOCK generator code before VIEW statement at the top.

The references in the layout code, which you wrote correctly needs a / added, i.e.

I've modified a bit the GUI just to add some labels.

Parsing really requires more effort from my part.

I'd like to add a file selection widget for input and another file selection one for output. 

And then the code to read the input file lines and  writing the modified data to the output file lines  until EOF.

Any idea will be welcomed

Francisco} "Francisco" "12-Sep-2010/18:42:21-7:00" {This is the simpler "mode" of parse, where the rule is just a list of characters used to split the string - in this case, the string is split at the characters required by your scenario (forward slash, space, and comma).

Be sure to add some code to confirm file overwrites and other potential issues.

I'm a little puzzled about exactly how you intend users to go through the file.

To enable REBOL/View console support in Ubuntu Linux, follow these instructions:

   1. Download the tar.gz file for Linux x86 - Fedora (Kernel 2.6).

   3. Look in the rebol-276 folder (or whatever version you've downloaded).

   5. Open a terminal window (Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal)
   6. Type "./rebview" (without the quotes), or "./rebol", depending on the version you've downloaded.

On some versions of Linux, you may need to run "./rebview +i" to install the required libs. For Ubuntu 10.04 and some versions of REBOL, you may need to run the following on the command line: http://re-bol.com/rebol_ubuntu1004.txt.} "Yuri" "1-Sep-2010/3:34:01-7:00" {Unbelievable, no?

However haven't seen anything since.  } "yuem" "31-Oct-2010/9:50:55-7:00" {I have only some coarse indications, but when I tested pure processing once, REBOL 2 was twice as fast as Ruby. Now Ruby is fairly slow, so REBOL is probably slower than the likes of Python and Perl.

My estimate is that REBOL is generally in the order of hundred times slower than a compiled C program. This is the kind of thing where JITs and RebCode can help, which usually yield speed improvements of tens of times, like twenty to thirty times faster. Cyphre's JIT is for REBOL 3 and is in private development, but you can ask him for it.

However, this seldomly matters. In most programs, algorithms dominate overall performance, instead of pure processing power. In REBOL, a smarter solution can often be found, leading to smaller code, which is a performance advantage in itself.

I'm developing a web framework on top of Cheyenne. Cheyennne performance compares well with other web servers, and the performance of my framework can also compete well with web frameworks in other languages.} "Kaj" "31-Oct-2010/13:35:14-7:00" {Thanks Kaj. I'm happy to trade the increase in running time for Rebol programs for the vast decrease in developing time, and of course you can always write a routine in C if you really need that speed increase, then call it from Rebol.} "Jules" "31-Oct-2010/14:29:11-7:00" {There will always be ways to put REBOL in a place where it performs badly compared to other languages. It often is about implementation of an algorithm or a principle that you can find places where REBOL is fast.

For example PARSE is much faster than you'd expect, so when you write your REBOL scripts to be dialect heavy, they could be very fast. Doing the same thing in other languages, might be very slow.

Math is not very fast in REBOL, not even in R3, so now that we have extensions, people should take advantage of C-based math libraries, if speed is critical.

Also as Kaj says, given that REBOL is very small and has small scripts, so these produce real-world side effects in very quick download and startup times.} "Henrik" "31-Oct-2010/17:28:45-7:00" {I found some useful info here for those wanting to optimise loops:

http://www.pointillistic.com/open-REBOL/moa/scream/rebol-iterator-comparison.txt

As Kaj & Henrik said, algorithm is the most important thing for performance.

Here is 2 functions I use to test speed of running a block:

    benchmark: func [b /local s] [s: now/precise loop 1000000 [do b] difference now/precise s]

    benchmark2: func [
        a
        b
        /local sa sb r
    ] [
        sa: now/precise loop 1000000 [do a] sa: difference now/precise sa
        sb: now/precise loop 1000000 [do b] sb: difference now/precise sb
        r: (to-decimal sa) / (to-decimal sb)
        print [
^-^-^-"Execution time for the #1 job:" sa newline
^-^-^-"Execution time for the #2 job:" sb newline
^-^-^-either sa > sb [
^-^-^-^-"#1 is slower than #2 by factor ~"
^-^-^-] [
^-^-^-^-"#1 is faster than #2 by factor ~"
^-^-^-]
^-^-^-either r > 1 [r] [1 / r]
        ]
        r
    ]

First one executes the given block for 1.000.000 times, you can change the iteration number because simple loops usually take less than a second.

Benchmark2 function takes 2 blocks and compares execution times of them.

Here is a quick exmaple: (create a string for one million times)
    >> benchmark [s: make string! 1024]
    == 0:00:01.297
    >> benchmark [s: make string! 256]
    == 0:00:00.61

    >> benchmark2 [s: make string! 1024] [s: make string! 256]
    Execution time for the #1 job: 0:00:01.313
    Execution time for the #2 job: 0:00:00.593
    #1 is slower than #2 by factor ~ 2.2141652613828
} "Endo" "1-Nov-2010/4:57:17-7:00" {And here is a real example: I need 10 million random generated rows (to insert a database)
First, I do it by simple creating a string and appending lines by a loop, then save it to a file.
This was the slowest one, because it is too expensive to grow a string.

Second, I created a block, append 10m blocks then form it (convert) to string then save to a file. This wasn't that bad.

And last, I opened a file in direct mode (without buffering) and append the lines to file. Takes just seconds.

There are some other minor things, for example if you have loops inside loops, you may need to choose the correct functions/commands. 
For example, FORALL is a function which uses FORSKIP which is another function uses WHILE (native) to iterate.
If you don't really need it, then you can use FOREACH (native).
But I would prefer readability over speed most of the time, for ex. if loops runs only once or two. No need to optimize.
Trying to optimize everything is a illness. I know because I'd have that also. I came from C64 & 68K assembly, we were trying to optimize every single op code. But this is not the case anymore.
Write readable code and let the compiler, interpreter, JIT etc. do the optimizations.

The initial request must have 3 values:

"n" = Number
"b" = batchID
"t" = tokenID

example:

http://roulettetips.cc/cgi-bin/API?n=<number>&b=<batch>&t=<token>

Once you get your sessionID, then there's no need to pass the batchID (b) and tokenID (t) parameters, since the client is going to be identified by the matching cookie and IP address as per the server-side stored session.

So a session might go like this:

Initial request:

http://roulettetips.cc/cgi-bin/API?n=34&b=123&t=abc>

2nd request:

http://roulettetips.cc/cgi-bin/API?n=18

3rd request:

http://roulettetips.cc/cgi-bin/API?n=5

etc.

At the moment, the batchID and TokenID can be any string, but n (the number) must be an integer in the range 0-36

So I need to send 3 values in the first request, get the cookie, and on subsequent requests send a number + cookie and store each line of the response (<status code>, <numbers>) in separate variables.

Objects, functions and functions in objects change variables in global scope, if they are not in specifically local to the function or object.

That section is about something else: there is an object named Bank and it sets (creates) a function in global scope which uses a local variable. (make-account)

Look at that line:
last-account: last-account + 1
last-account is a local variable but make-account is not local to bank object. You can call it without bank/make-account notation.

And note that last-account is already set in the object definition to make it local otherwise it will be global.

Briefly, you need to define variables when creating object to make them local to the object. And you need to use /local refinement for functions.} "Endo" "13-Nov-2010/16:14:53-8:00" {enddo,  thanks for the explanations.

} "yuem" "14-Nov-2010/13:08:41-8:00" {The LAYOUT function is spoiling your expectations, because it reads the set-word O from your block into a word VAR, which then is used like this in a line of code in LAYOUT:

if :var [set :var new var: none]

Where NEW is the face that is currently being processed. VAR contains the word that will be set with the face name, in your case O.

This follows the rule that when using SET on a word, it will automatically be either global or restricted to the context in which SET is used, if the word is already set there.

The context cannot control the words that are set by a function (here LAYOUT), unless you know which ones to restrict.

Hence, Graham's solution is correct.} "Henrik" "14-Nov-2010/14:20:26-8:00" {thanks Henrik for your explanations,

rebol is focusing only on the m_f1 field in editobject ,  but it does not focus on m_f1 in the addobject.

there is interference between the 2 objects.

You are calling focus m_f1 during the object creation. So your m_f1 field gets focus just for the first time.

You need to set focus just before to View your layout. Try this:
focus addobject/m_f1
view center-face addobject/m_capturepanel

focus editObject/m_f1
view editobject/m_editpanel

This will work as expected with no variable interference.

Briefly, you cannot say, in this object focus should be on this field and in the second object focus will be on that field. Focus can only be on one gui item at a time.} "Endo" "15-Nov-2010/9:44:53-8:00" {Or put a function in each object to show itself correctly:

yes if I group both objects in the one .r file, then I have to use a function for the show.

whas I have done is put the objects in separate .r file and then do either one when it is needed.

I had some problem because I am used to the java way , where if I have two separate screen classes in one .java file, you could  .setFocus to multiple fields in different screen classes even if they are in the same .java file.  similar to the approach i was using in my example.

I faced a problem when using this function, I had a reasonably big function in a reasonably big object (gui). First I use that function just for its return value so everything was ok.
But then I added some code to change some gui vars. It didn't work with NO error ofcourse.
It took thirty minutes to find out what it going on, I PROBED everything, everything had a value, so why it didn't work. Then I remembered I used FUNCT.

Here is a quick example:
    b: 1
    o: context [
        a: 1
        f: funct [][a: 2 b: 2]
    ]

    o/f
    o/a
    == 1 ;not 2

Of course it is easy to see the problem when your object/function is not that big. But when they are getting bigger or if you added some new codes a few months later then you may forget.

I have a quick solution, I changed FUNCT color to red using my text editor's syntax highlighting feature :)
} "Endo" "2-Nov-2010/3:57:52-7:00" {Ofcourse you can do this, it will work as expected:
    o: context [

     o: context [ 
         a: 1 
         f: funct/with [][a: 2 b: 2] self
     ]

That binds the function to the object first and excludes the object's words from the function's locals. When FUNCT/with is passed an object reference the function becomes something like a friend function in C++. When passed a block the function gets a local object to store static words in.} "BrianH" "10-Dec-2010/0:23:11-8:00" {Thank you BrainH, that is great.

Here is the complete solution. I think we should put this on rebol.net as an article. So many people can fail to run Rebol under IIS7 as a CGI module.

Open Server Manager from Administrative Tools.
Add role "Web Server (IIS)"
Try http://localhost/ from your browser. You should see the IIS7 Welcome Page.

Copy core.exe to c:\ (or somewhere else), right click on core.exe and open Properties window, give Read & Execute access to IUSR_xxxx under Security tab. (If you've any problem, try to give Read & Execute for Everyone)

Open "Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager" from Administrator Tools.

Click on Default Web Sites, double click on Handler Mappings, click on Add Module Mapping from the right panel and type the followings:

Request Path: *.r
Module: c:\core.exe -cs %s %s
Name: Rebol

Create a test.r file under wwwroot folder. My test.r file contains following script:

    R E B O L [Title: "Server Time"]
    print "content-type: text/html^^/"
    print [<HTML><BODY>]
    print ["Date/time is:" now]
    print [</pre></BODY></HTML>]

And type http://localhost/test.r on your browser.
If everything goes well then it should work.

If you are trying with View.exe then you may need to put --noinstall to command line, otherwise when View start with IUSR_xxx user account it will open desktop & installation window and it stays background (you can see it from Task Manager).

    c:\view.exe -csi %s %s

You may need to put double quotes around %s if your script is in a path with spaces. Use the following form:

    c:\core.exe -cs "%s %s"

Instead of this:

    c:\core.exe "-cs %s %s" (<-- this won't work!)} "Endo" "13-Dec-2010/11:13:58-8:00" {And select Yes when Add Script Map dialog box appears.

Very thanks for some's help about Port!.} "limux" "15-Dec-2010/10:38:41-8:00" {Reading the data of a direct access port with copy function will move port's head forward. So the port will always be at it's head position.
The http-port in above codes is a port with direct refinement, isn't it?} "limux" "16-Dec-2010/6:51:20-8:00" {Ping-demo: I can reproduce your issue. I've increased the sleep delay in async-call.r (OS/Sleep line) to 10ms and it's now stable here. I've uploaded the patched version at: http://sidl.fr/async-call.r 


Notepad: I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve in your console example...call:// is an asynchronous scheme, so it requires proper initialization and an event loop in order to run, like this: 

    p: open call://
    p/locals: make p/locals [                       ;-- install at least one callback
        show-window: yes
        on-completed: func [port][probe "closed!"]  ;-- see ping-demo.r for other callbacks
    ]
    append system/ports/wait-list p                 ;-- add the port to system's wait list

    insert p "notepad.exe"                          ;-- init a new job
    do-events                                       ;-- starts an event loop
 
    ...
    "closed!"                                       ;-- printed when notepad.exe is closed

If you just want to run a command without blocking, the native CALL does the job well. Call:// was designed to address the specific case where you need both non-blocking call and getting stdout data from the called process while it's running.

Remember that this is a hack in REBOL event/port system (because real custom events cannot be generated in R2, not sure for R3), so events are faked by forcing REBOL to call the scheme's event handler code by using a polling method (with now a 10ms delay between each poll). I can't guarantee that this will work reliably in all contexts.

This one has been a monumental effort - 20+ hours a day, 7 days a week, for nearly 2 months straight.  I haven't seen my family.  I haven't spoken to friends.  I haven't done anything but work to get this enormous project off the ground - and now it's finally open and running.  http://merchantsvillage.com is on it's feet, and it is running well :)  I took a 120,000 square foot former Walmart building, and turned it into a gigantic indoor market square.  We opened November 27, 2010 and we currently have 110 vendors.  We're growing by 4-5 vendors per day, every day.  In fewer than two weeks we've seen over 10,000 customers!  It's a very big deal in the area - we've received an enormous amount of positive regional press (on the nightly news regularly).  Our overhead is more than $50,000 per month, and we're almost at the breakeven point - within the first 2 weeks :)

The cool thing about all this is that everything in the business runs on software created from the ground up in REBOL :)  Bar codes are printed for items the vendors sell, sales are rung up at checkout registers (we're as busy as any Walmart at Christmas time - 29 acres of parking lot FULL on the weekends), reports are printed, and money is dispersed, the web site is edited regularly, work schedules are created, data is backed up in real time, etc.  It's a HUGE operation - and it's ALL REBOL, REBOL, REBOL making it happen every minute of the day :)

Really great to read that there is big business running on Rebol softwares. 
Is it possible to have an overview of the technical architecture ? server part ? how many client applications in the store ? Database ?

} "deglingo" "18-Dec-2010/6:11:45-8:00" {Hi Deglingo,

There are 7 main parts to the software that runs operations:

Bar code ordering/printing:

Vendors place orders for bar codes they need, to sell at our point of sale checkout registers.  Each booth can choose from 9999 numbers/descriptions that are unique to their individual booths.  We have three kiosks in the building at which they can enter orders.  The bar code ordering application is also available on our web site, for download, so that vendors can organize and price their items away from our location.  Vendors can email their orders (often many thousands of labels), so that they're ready for use when the vendors arrive to stock inventory.  Labels simply contain booth, item, and price information, in human readable and code39 format.  The bar codes are printed on standard Avery address labels, rendered using the PDF dialect by Gabriele Santilli.  The operating software has a simple interface for our employees to import and print the label orders (our operations software uses RebGUI for the UI).

Point of sale:

Our employees run checkout registers at the front of the building.  Shoppers pick items from any of the booths, and pay for them at the front registers.  We use inexpensive netbook machines with keyboard wedge scanners attached, to do the point of sale data entry (we still have Walmart's register hardware, and we display the sales on nice 19 inch monitors, so the checkouts look professional and modern to the customers).  The data entered via scanner is simply parsed and placed into a listview data grid.  Taxes and totals are automatically calculated, and options are provided for tax-free sales, for deleting and holding sales, and for other common transaction activities.  The data for each sale is simply stored in separate text files - no database - files are named by the date, time, and cashier's name, using an easily parsable naming convention.  This is the heart of the system, and is limited only by the file system.  The software automatically archives files after each pay period, so that response times are instant, even when run on a slow network.  We run operations most days with 1-4 cashiers, but we could easily support 15 registers, just using stock Windows 7 starter machines.  Because there's no database, we could replace a totally broken server in a matter of minutes (as long as it takes to copy the receipts data folder).  Customer receipts are rendered to HTML files and printed using inexpensive Brother laser printers.

Reporting:

Vendors can obtain reports of sales which have been made, from any starting day/time to any ending day/time, whenever they want.  The reporting system simply reads the receipts file directory, parses the name of each file (which contains the dates and times of each sale), and then runs through each file which should be included in the report, collecting info about items sold by the specified vendor.  Totals of the sales items, taxes, and grand total, are provided, along with info about dates, times, cashier and other info about each individual item that was sold.  The whole reporting process takes a couple seconds, even for reports with hundreds of printed pages of items.  I created an additional large report that automatically runs individual reports and totals for each vendor in the entire building, to be run at the end of each 2 week pay period.  We also have a report to total sales at each POS register, made by each individual cashier, to close and total the register after each employee's work shift.

Backup:

All data is regularly backed up and saved to local and network drives, as well as an FTP server off site.  These simple scripts just constantly look through each data folder in the "server" directory for files not contained in the backup folders, and copy any files not found.
    
Check writing:

At the end of every 2 weeks, we write checks to each of the vendors for the items they've sold.  We run the report to provide subtotals for items, tax, credit card charges, etc.  Managers can request checks for vendor payments - they are rendered in PDF format, and uploaded to the web site.  If I'm not on site, I can view the checks and approve them remotely.  When I approve them, the checks are then digitally signed and downloaded in a batch by the managers, where they're printed on our normal check paper.  Managers can use this process to write checks for any other accounts - if I'm not there locally, I can approve them from anywhere I have an Internet connection.

Scheduling:

We do some daily scheduling using a tiny program that I wrote in 5 minutes - we've decided to use a third party fingerprint recognition system to manage time clock operations, so this part of the REBOL system will be discontinued.

Security:

I wrote a very simple image retrieval and archiving system that works with wireless IP cameras.  Images are constantly snapped and saved to 2TB drives, again using a simple file naming convention that contains the date, time, and camera name.  It display thumbnails of each image (24 total on each machine), which can be clicked to show a larger view of the incoming images.  There's a search and scroll feature that simply runs through the file listing to search and review images.

None of the system is rocket science, but it's been very reliable and fast.  New client machines can be added in the time it takes to install REBOL/View, connect to a mapped drive, and run approximately 200k of REBOL code.  Setting up the entire software system at a new location will take me less then an hour (it will take much much longer to just unbox, connect, tie down, etc. all the hardware). 

Here are some screen shots of the operations software:  http://re-bol.com/merchants_village_screen_shots.zip

Of course, I use my sitebuilder CGI software to manage the web site, and many other typical REBOL tools that I've created for other businesses, to help organize my daily activities.} "Nick" "19-Dec-2010/1:10:19-8:00" {Nick, thanks very much for this detailed explanation...I wish you lots of a success for your business in the coming year !

I'm assuming you wanted an i++ increment in your while loop:

while (i <= n) {
    sum += i*i;
    i++;
}

A REBOL equivalent to your program is:

main: does [
     n: to-integer ask "Input integer: " 
     if n < 0 [return 1]
     sum: 0
     i: 0 
     while [i <= n] [
         sum: sum + (i * i)
         i: i + 1
     ] 
     print sum
     return 0
]

main} "Nick" "19-Jan-2011/1:15:50-8:00" {But this is much more REBOLish:

do main: [
    sum: 0
    repeat i to-integer ask "number: " [sum: sum + (i * i)] 
    sum
]} "Nick" "19-Jan-2011/1:30:56-8:00" {Here is another version in one-line:

    sum: 0 repeat i either 0 < n: to-integer ask "" [n] [1] [sum: i * i + sum]

Copy & paste this line into Console and try.} "Endo" "19-Jan-2011/4:12:24-8:00" {Here is the explanation:

set sum variable to 0. (sum: 0)
get input from user. (ask "")
convert it to integer. (to-integer)
if it is a positive number then return it else return 1. (either 0 < n [n] [1])
repeat the block [sum: i * i + sum], n times, count i from 1 to n.

if user input is not a number then to-integer gives invalid argument error. You can simply ignore that error by using an attempt.

    attempt [sum: 0 repeat i either 0 < n: to-integer ask "" [n] [1] [sum: i * i + sum]]

which returns none if any error occurs in the given block.

Or you can give show an error message, using try:

    either error? try [sum: 0 repeat i either 0 < n: to-integer ask "" [n] [1] [sum: i * i + sum]] [print "Please enter a number."] [sum]

if no error occurred return sum.} "Endo" "19-Jan-2011/4:22:07-8:00" {That's one of the things I love about REBOL - there's less cruft than any other language.

s: 0 repeat i to-integer ask "" [s: i * i + s] s} "Nick" "21-Jan-2011/0:15:08-8:00" {And that is what I love about Rebol, in any other language when you try to make your code smaller it is getting complicated, unreadable.

The examples that come in the above download are straightforward and comfortably REBOLish.  They should be easy enough to follow, just by reading the comments.  In the tutorial in the /docs folder, Max says that the high level dialect may change, so expect some eventual changes to the syntax.  It sounds like Windows is the only OS that Glass has been tested on fully.

The immediate appearance of Glass looks more modern than VID, window resizing works nicely, and there are some cool demonstrated effects, such as the sliding panels in the file browser demo.

Here are the styles that Max lists as currently included in Glass (it strikes me that a grid/table style is missing):

LABELS
----------
label^-^-^-^-: basic text label
title^-^-^-^-: big bold label
subtitle^-^-^-: smaller title
headline^-^-^-: smaller subtitle
bold-label^-^-^-: same as label but bold
auto-label^-^-^-: auto-resizing label

tool-icon^-^-: same as icon but using a different icon set name (see crypt keeper for details)


COMPLEX CONTROLS
----------
list^-^-^-: a standard list style, without scrollbar

Pity really, these are $400 printers being chucked out.} "Graham" "9-Feb-2011/3:40:48-8:00" {This _shouldn't_ be too difficult.  REBOL serial port documentation is at http://www.rebolforces.com/archive/rep/rep004.html .  Page 217 of the printer manual shows how to send hex control codes to the printer in DOS and BASIC.  The Basic example is below:

    LPRINT CHR$(&H12); "ABC"; CHR$(&H0A)

Try this:

    printer: open/no-wait serial://
    insert printer #{12}
    insert printer to-hex to-integer #"A"
    insert printer to-hex to-integer #"B"
    insert printer to-hex to-integer #"C"
    insert printer #{0A}
    print copy printer
    close printer

You'll probably need to change REBOL's default serial port settings for port, speed, data bits, parity, stop bits, rts-cts, etc., based on how the machine is configured.  The /binary, /direct and /no-wait refinements might also apply:

    printer: open/binary/direct/no-wait serial://com2/4800/8/none/1
    printer/rts-cts: false
    update printer

I'm not sure if you even need to convert the characters to hex, or if you could just send a string.  Either way, a simple function to send each character in hex format could be something like:

send2printer: func [str] [
    foreach chr str [
        insert printer to-hex to-integer to-char chr
    ]
]

Since I don't have the hardware, I can't experiment with it at all.  Lemme know how you progress!

I have made some progress with colors and thinner borders and such, but several issues stemming from my general ignorance remain still.

For one thing, I caught some references to antialiasing from the source, but couldn't find anything about it from the docs. Only something about drawing vectorial fonts with AGG.

Secondly, how does one style sub-elements. For example http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yGJazRaB

Third, what would be the rational way to reduce repetition. Right now, the color and edge rules are repeat for every element that needs them. How could this be made shorter?

Thanks if you can clarify any of these at all!} "luminarious" "11-Feb-2011/7:54:17-8:00" {First question:

In REBOL 2, there are really two graphics engines, which is put together in a way that is a bit silly:

The first one is View, which is used for drawing user interface elements. It's the engine you use, when you are writing code to stylize UI elements differently, like in your example. The problem is that it doesn't support anti-aliased fonts at all and can't do rich text. The upside is that it supports adjusted and centered text. Worse is, that if you enable ClearType in Windows, the fonts will sometimes appear with pixel artifacts.

The second one is AGG, which works as a subset of View and can be used inside a face as an effect option. It supports anti-aliasing, but there is just about zero font metrix information available to you, so you can't wrap, flow or center text easily. This engine can't do rich text either. It is possible to add it, by "borrowing" View's methods but it's slow.

REBOL 3 solves this by getting rid of the first engine, making AGG the View engine and adding full support for font metrics, adjustments and rich text everywhere.

Second question:

This depends if the item is dynamically generated during layout, but you can much of the time do:

text-list: text-list with [edge: make edge [size: 1x1]]

Third question:

There are many tricks that work on different levels. You can do something like:

my-edge: [size: 1x1 color: red]

stylize [
  button: button edge my-edge
]

Also, I tend to use stylize/master, so you don't have to manually add the style sheet to every layout. Then it will be global for all layouts.} "Henrik" "11-Feb-2011/8:23:28-8:00" {Thank you Henrik!

Some other ideas:

1. For thread starters, if the title and the author name is the same, it's likely spam, as it was in this case.

2. Keep the last 1000 posts in memory and compare them to the incoming post. This automatically removes accidental double posts and repeat spammers. There were many double posts in this case.

3. Some form of throttling of thread starts: Only 1 new thread per 20 seconds or similar. Spambots usually post in bursts and they like to post threads to fill up the front page. That was also the case here.

Each method is only a few lines of code. :-)} "Henrik" "4-Mar-2011/4:08:09-8:00" {4. Another throttle method could be to measure the time between, showing a form and receiving a good captcha, i.e. when the form is submitted correctly.

1) user registration and login

2) intelligent quiz - whether mathematical or general question

3) detect ip and disallow greater than x number of posts in a day  or even blacklist some ips.

4) user rating - trusted vs non trusted userids, people who have posted for a long time have higher rating and new people who nobody knows about have a lower rating.

However I'm a little puzzled by what appears to be an inconsistency (I'm sure it isn't, but this is how it seems to me until I'm put right).

Example:

>> a: [1 1] ; assign to a
== [1 1]
>> b: a ; assign a to b
== [1 1]
>> b
== [1 1]
>> append a 2
== [1 1 2]
>> b
== [1 1 2]
>> unique a
== [1 2]
>> b
== [1 1 2]

After assigning a to b (which was initially []) when I append to a then b is also changed, but when I use the "unique" function on a then b is NOT changed, why not?

} "Mike" "24-Mar-2011/6:30:29-7:00" {Try

a

You'll see that it is still the original series, the same as b, because you didn't reassign a.

Many functions do an implicit COPY to make programming safer and, hopefully, less surprising.} "Kaj" "24-Mar-2011/12:16-7:00" {Thanks Kaj. I must admit I'm finding this confusing.

Here's the example with a reassigned:

>> a: [1 1]

>> b: a ; assign a to b
== [1 1]
>> b ; b is now the same as a
== [1 1]
>> a: append a 2 
== [1 1 2]
>> b
== [1 1 2] ; b is now also a
>> ; now get unique a
>> a: unique a
== [1 2]
>> b
== [1 1 2] ;b isn't affected

It just seems a little arbitrary that UNIQUE does COPY but APPEND doesn't. How do I find out which functions do an implicit COPY and which don't?

Or have I misunderstood completely?} "Mike" "24-Mar-2011/13:18:09-7:00" {You can somehow guess which one changes the series,

append, insert, change, poke: changes the current series.

intersect, unique, union: creates a new one(copies)

UNIQUE is hard to guess because it operates on one series. As Endo noted, by consistency with the other set operations that combine two sets, it copies.

When you pass pointers to an external library function, the function can change the values of the pointers. To determine which pointer values were changed by an external library function, use the following method:

Use second on the routine! value, which returns a structure.
Then, use first on the struct! returned from second. This returns a block of the potentially changed values that were passed to the external library function.} "Nick" "6-May-2011/4:56:28-7:00" {This should work:

This will write all environment vars into S as string. Then you can parse it:

    foreach b parse/all s crlf  [append [] copy/part b find b #"="]

This will return names of all env. vars in a block.

    == ["ALLUSERSPROFILE" "APPDATA" "CommonProgramFiles" "COMPUTERNAME" ...


And also you can get names and the values in one block:

    env: copy [] foreach b parse/all s crlf  [append env reduce [copy/part b t: find b #"=" copy t]]

so you can select any of them easily:

    >> select env "windir"

One of my pet projects is personal cloud services using a plug computer. I think Rebol would be an exceptional fit for these devices.

How many years Rebol 3 is in the making ?

That's one of the reasons, at my workplace, the bosses  chose Ruby over Rebol. there seems to be more activity and maturity and also a very wide ecosystem in the more vibrant ruby community. just take a look at rubyforge to have an idea of how many things are happening, + also the interests of Apple, Sun(thoughtworks) , Microsoft, Engine Yard in the language.

<b> Advantages of ruby:- </b>
- very good documentation
- more mature, a bigger and more active community, 
- concise language, 
- code blocks, 
- easy to learn and quick return on investment, 
- has many good web frameworks like rails, merb, sinatra etc... 
- good gui libaries, fxruby, wxruby , qt, GTK etc.. 
- can talk to MS Office apps well, and also enterprise friendly.
- community can survive even if Matz disappears i.e not a one man community,and less risky investment, 
- major corporations interested and directly involved in the language:- Microsoft (iron ruby),  Sun through the JVM and also (JRuby), other backers are Engine Yard, thoughtworks, and also supported directly by Apple (mac osx) 
- Jruby can use the vast number of java libraries available out there,  Iron ruby can leverage the .Net libraries.
- Principle of least surprise in the design. language design to make programmer happy.
- friendly and helpful community, bigger ecosystem. 
- Many very good professional level ides available like intellij, eclipse, netbeans, radrails, rubymine, too many to list ...
- good metaprogramming
- cross platform
- scalable especially if you use JVM or .Net
- free and open source



<b> Disadvantages of Ruby: </b>
- a bit slow, it is interpreted, however this is no longer a problem, especially if you go with 
JRuby(Java platform) and Iron Ruby(.Net). also ruby 1.9 is faster than ruby 1.8.
- environment is bigger. 
- Not as big a name as java or C#
- doesn't run on iphone/ipad



<b> Advantages of Rebol </b>
- small env less than 1 Mb, 
- small is beautiful philosophy. 
- concise language e.g gui is simple for simple things. 
- friendly and helpful community. 
- has a great future if it opens up and buids a big active community. some interesting ideas. 
- good metaprogramming
- cross platform
- partly free, and partly open

<b> Disadvantages of Rebol </b>
- <b> acute lack of documentation </b>
- big investments in terms of effort to learn and master because of lack of docs  
- no available hot web framework, embedded rebol code with html.
- not enterprise ready and cannot interact very well with msoffice apps, 
- Interpreted and slow.
- not mature enough. gui is very difficult for complex screens, gui is very primitive
- language has some weird/dangerous behaviour when it comes to behaviour of series in a loop or a function. wywinwyg - What You Write Is Not What You Get.
- big programs are not very readable, made worse when coders cram a lot in one line.
- very small community and small ecosystem as well
- mainly a one man effort, investment in the language at risk if the creator disappears
- transition from rebol2 to rebol3 taking too long, ( our need is for a working language now not 5 years down the road.)
- global scoping, you cannot make a  function/variable in an object private. any other
object can call all the functions in another object. bad program design principle. for example, we need ability to have private functions which other objects are not able to call.
- no true rebol ide 
- no multi threading
- litte known about its scalability.
- full/complete stack not available
- doesn't run on iphone/ipad


} "yuem" "4-Jul-2010/0:17:27-7:00" {"language has some weird/dangerous behaviour when it comes to behaviour of series in a loop or a function. wywinwyg - What You Write Is Not What You Get."

Actually you do and the behavior is well-defined, but it's difficult to know, if one doesn't know how REBOL handles series inside loops. It's the old "copy trap" all over again that could be solved by simply asking other developers. Many beginners fall into this, but it's easy to overcome.

"big programs are not very readable, made worse when coders cram a lot in one line."

Programs are as readable or as unreadable as you make them. I would think that counts for any language.

"No true REBOL IDE"

That's usually because REBOL doesn't require one to work, a good side effect of its design. I've tried writing an IDE several times, but found that instead of helping me, it gets in the way. It's better to focus on having a good text editor to manage lots of files and an easy way to execute scripts from the editor.
If you need some kind of preprocessor to build large scripts from many small script files, REBOL Technology already offers one in less than 200 lines of code, which is fully documented on rebol.com here:

http://www.rebol.com/docs/sdk/prebol.html

Integrating REBOL into another IDE, like visual studio is a different matter, which R3 will solve.

http://pappg.com is the same. 

Now your point of "making money" isn't because you use Rebol.. it's because of the applications / market, if anything. 

AND... in all honesty, you could increase market share by updating your stuff. } "Yuri" "21-Aug-2010/3:18:28-7:00" {Yuri, 

My skill and interest in graphic design has never been strong.  I actually disdain the focus on graphic design in software development - they're two separate topics.  The Rockfactory web page design is a simple table layout that I came up with 13 years ago, and it's suited my needs well, so I continue to use it for many small sites.  I dominate my little markets, and couldn't improve market share much, if at all, so I'm not motivated to change the look of the sites.  Of course I agree, the web sites and software could use the touch of a good graphic artist to look prettier - and because I'm using a template system for page layout, changing out the look of the sites would take approximately 5 seconds and the click of a single button.  But it's just not important to me.  The visual layout is totally separate from the working code.  The pages that I created for pappg.com were done <i>exactly</i> to the specs that the site owner requested - not my design.  But again, that's totally separate from the function the pages provide.  I posted screen shots of the Merchant's Village software to show that it actually exists, not to show a pretty GUI example - Shadwolf asked for proof of projects that I'd completed which were commercially successful, and that's something I have to show which has made a lot of money.

But that's not the point.  Using another software development tool would NOT have changed the look of those web layouts.  My graphic design skills are what they are, and those skills are separate from my logical abilities to write working software code.  The reason I use REBOL is because it's always been more PRODUCTIVE then other development tools.  There's no other tool that would've enabled me to write as much useful software in the same amount of time with so little effort.  I use one simple little tool for everything - web development, critical multiuser data management software, multimedia applications, network apps, etc., all in commercial use for years and enabling my businesses to run productively.  No software development team - just me, writing applications in my spare time, using the simplest and most productive development environment available.  Your point was that "REBOL is a hobby at best", and you're INCORRECT about that.  REBOL is obviously not your tool of choice.  That's fine - I don't have any argument with you about that.  I'm going to continue to use REBOL because it has been, and still continues to be the best and most productive tool for the work I need to complete.  If there are other tools that fit your needs and interests better, then move on and use what's right for you.  My point was just to counter the sentiment that REBOL is not capable as anything but hobbyist's toy, for those who are interested.  In my experience, REBOL has been an extraordinarily productive business computing tool, and I couldn't have achieved the same ends without it.} "Nick" "21-Aug-2010/9:55:05-7:00" {Yuri, an important point you seem to have missed, and the reason for my long post at the link above was the fact that I've created an <i>enormous</i> variety of useful custom software tools with REBOL.  What you see on the web site is mostly just a trivial bit of marketing information.  The tools that we use to <i>get real work done</i> on a daily basis - to be <i>productive, in life and the real world</i> are all written in REBOL.  Those tools have useful depth, and they are pervasive in every part of the work we do on a daily basis.  Most of those tools are used internally - you don't see them on the public web site - they're not about marketing or pretty advertising, but functionality, and there are a <i>lot</i> of them, helping to enable and manage a <i>lot</i> of activity, both in commercial and personal settings.  I create software solutions for my real life needs, quickly and easily with REBOL.  For me, REBOL's productivity benefits have made it an invaluable development tool, over and over and over again.  That's why I use it.  You're using this web site to communicate with me, and it was written in REBOL in a matter of hours :)  Of course it could be prettier...} "Nick" "21-Aug-2010/11:45:37-7:00" {To keep this entire conversation in one place, here's a repost of what I wrote at the link above.

Shadwolf, 

This business runs entirely on REBOL: http://rockfactory.us . Daily scheduling, accounting, web site maintenance, event scheduling, student signin notification and other workflow apps, as well as programs that play and print music, which we use to teach and practice in many hundreds of lessons a week, are all written in REBOL. I've employed 25+ instructors at that business for the past 6 years.

This business runs entirely on REBOL: http://www.myzeusscloset.com . I created the program that handles their point of sale, inventory management, accounting, check writing activities, and more, entirely in REBOL (their web site was done by someone else).

I wrote the software system for this business, from the ground up in REBOL: http://merchantsvillage.com .

Here are some screen shots of that software: http://re-bol.com/merchants_village_screen_shots.zip

The member pages and classified ads for this site run entirely on REBOL CGI programs: http://pappg.com (look at member #1). 

I also own a number of personal sites that are #1, 2, or 3 in Google for their respective search terms, all of which owe something to REBOL. Look up "paramotor tutorial" (#1, written in makedoc), "live online music lessons" (#1, many features of that web site are REBOL), "computer programming tutorial" (#3, written about REBOL), etc. 

I've written many hundreds of small scripts and utilities that I use daily in my work and personal life. There are several hundred pages of examples at re-bol.com/examples.txt 

The work that I've been able to accomplish with the help of programs that I've written in REBOL has contributed over a million dollars to my net worth. Is that enough to satisfy your curiosity?

www.rockfactory.com seems to be using <strong>Perl</strong>. 


And I responded:

There's one old script that still handles form mail there.

Here's a quick rundown of REBOL code that Rockfactory relies on: 

* My REBOL sitebuilder.cgi is used to edit content and build all the main publicly viewable pages of the Rockfactory site. 

* My REBOL web-tool.cgi is used to upload, download, search, backup, perform file/folder manipulation, and to perform all other general site maintenance operations. 

* The recital_signup.cgi is used, along with a GUI desktop REBOL app, to organize all public events at which students perform. 

* Here's a screen shot of the REBOL signin.r program that students use to sign in to every lesson, every time they come to the shop: http://re-bol.com/signin_screenshot2.jpg . That ties into a notification system in each lesson studio that audibly announces to each individual instructor when their next student has arrived (only for their own students). That in turn keeps a searchable history (which is backed up on the web site) of every student signin that has ever occured. 

* Every day, teachers check out (settle payment) using a REBOL desktop application which allows them to automatically select students they've seen that day, from their online schedule. A full backup of all this data is saved online, and a REBOL cgi application can be accessed by any teacher at any time to generate reports for records of lesson history for any time period, for any student or group of students. The entire detailed history of every single lesson we've ever given, and every single payment we've ever received is all immediately available and searchable online. 

* A version of the clock-sync.r script (built into the checkout program) automatically keeps all the computer clocks in the building synced to the same time. 

* ALL Rockfactory checks are all printed using a custom REBOL check writing program. It stores the names of all our vendors, default recurring payment amounts, etc. and prints everything, including the verbalized payment amount, signature, etc., on our custom bank checks. 

* We use guitar-chords.r to teach a standardized method of jazz chord study to guitarists. Chord charts for every song that students perform in their local school jazz band concerts get printed out using that program. 

* We use the chord-accompaniment-player.r program every day to generate chord progressions (audible song backgrounds) to practice with. 

* Vocal intructors use a version of the jukebox.r program to remove vocals from recordings, to create Karaoke versions of the songs, for students practice with. 

* Teachers, staff, and students use the intercom.r to speak with each other (voice over IP) without having to get up and and walk between studio rooms, waiting rooms, management offices, etc. An internal REBOL file server is also used to transfer files between rooms. 

* The reschedule.cgi page on the web site is used to manage up-to-the-minute rescheduling of students on a daily basis. This is the most critical part of our daily workflow, and is one of the biggest advantages we offer to teachers over other studios - our teachers get immediate notifications directly in their daily schedules (viewable online in any browser), and by email, with requested reschedule times, picked by students, from their available open appointment times (that info is also immediately available online to clients, on the reschedule page). Our secretary also gets a notification of each request, and each rescheduled appointment initiated online (5-20 per day) saves an average of 4 phone calls (per EACH request), or LOTS of time, money, and frustration for us. 

* The rescheduler ties into a significant backend scheduling system that teachers and secretarial staff use to organize hundreds of weekly appointments with 25+ teachers. 

* The entire system can be managed using REBOL CGI applications that run on a standard tiny WAP cell phone browser - I use my little clamshell phone to organize my online schedule and personal data every single day - no smart phone required.

* There are also several REBOL console scripts for Windows Mobile that I used for years to manage the entire system. 

* Everything about the online videoconference lessons except the actual video/audio tranfer (login, IP tracking, scheduling, file transfer, etc.) is also all managed by REBOL cgi scripts. 

* I regularly use my remove-emails-cgi.r script to delete Rockfactory spam email. 

* I use my chmod777to555.rto help manage security on the web site. 

* My forum.cgi script is used internally to carry on interactions between staff and students regarding rehearsal and performance activities, equipment use, etc. 

* My simple_search.r script is used every day to search for curriculum files and other text documents that get handed out to students. 

* So many other little scripts have been useful. I used the my web-cam.r script to take photos of all the teachers. We've made fun use of the voice-alarms.r script. It'd be impossible for me to think of all the one/several liners I've created on the the spot for some special use. 

Everything I've listed here is code that I've written from the ground up in REBOL, usually in my spare time. 

As it turns out, the only part of the Rockfactory computing setup that ever gives me trouble is that stupid PERL mail script on Rockfactory.us. I've been meaning to switch it out for a more reliable REBOL script that I've used elsewhere, which puts notifications directly into our scheduling system. Maybe that makes it more clear that Rockfactory's computing needs are decidedly NOT DRIVEN BY PERL. Thanks for the reminder to switch out that little form mail script :)

Blocks, for example. It is just a block following a CASE, it is not a syntax rule. "there should be some code inside [] brackets after CASE" -NO.
You can simple write CASE B, and it works if B is a block. You can get that block from a network port, read from a file, or build it on-the-fly. doesn't matter. just a block.

I'm new to forums and new to REBOL, though I did briefly investigate (a few months ago) how feasible and/or popular it is as a programming  language. I did check the tutorials, but only glanced over them - had a look again yesterday Sat 17th and I have to admit its got the 'wanting to programme blood' flowing again - and hopfully I'll have time in the near future to study them in more detail. I have a couple of small projects I'd like to do in REBOL as part of my learning of the language, though the karaoke player wasnt one of them; its just a friends interest, so I thought I'd see could it be done with REBOL. Yeah I'll have a look at that code 
Endo - it looks like the bare nuts&bolts - but if you dont get the nuts&bolts sorted - the bigger machine might never be built... Even though I dont know REBOL, I feel it could deal with all the intricacies of what makes a good karaoke player, but a problem for me is not knowing how and if REBOL can read the various audio+graphic formats that karaoke discs use - formats that are not usually part of media players in windows?

The VID Extension Kit is a GUI system built on top of VID. It offers resizing, different appearance, a comprehensive list of styles, keyboard navigation and functions to make it easier to do programming in the large.

The VID Extension Kit is currently available through GitHub here:

https://github.com/henrikmk/VID-Extension-Kit

In this latest version, the VID Extension Kit is no longer compatible with LIST-VIEW, since it offers its own DATA-LIST style, a faster and more elegant substitute.

A range of click-and-run demos are available in the Tests/ directory.

Despite the name, the VID Extension Kit does not really allow running plain VID programs (it did in the beginning), and the editor and viewtop are not functioning, when using the VID Extension Kit.

Licensing is not yet settled.

Data-list depends on about 5-6 different other styles. It also uses the VID Extension Kit resizing system to provide internal resizing as well as modified a window event handler to throttle events in a way to make it faster than LIST-VIEW.

There is also a context for handling sorting, filtering, column order, etc. which is intended for use in other styles.} "Henrik" "4-Jul-2011/3:56:17-7:00" {Henrik, thanks for the response and for all the hard work - I'm looking forward to putting it to use.} "Nick" "4-Jul-2011/15:05:34-7:00" {My site is now fixed, and details and docs about the VID Extension Kit can be read here:

The 20 is changed to whatever the drop-down selects. Once a new number is selected the script no longer sees the "20" because it's been replaced. 
I could do this with searching for a character at a certain location but I don't want to do it that way because the location of the "--op 20" may change in that field in the future when I add more options. 
I would like the script to be able to just search for the number after the "--op" and update that number in the f5 field with whatever I selected in the drop-down. } "Tony" "8-Dec-2011/11:35:26-8:00"]["Answer for below thread" {Finally figured out how to do it -

} "Endo" "12-Dec-2011/7:53:42-8:00"]["Lessons Learned After Following Rebol for 12 Years" {Going to point out a few things I've learned over the past 12 years following Rebol.. but first, a little background;

It seems like yesterday.. :)

I had just sold my ISP business to an American corp in 1998 after pioneering the commercial internet here in Canada. (4th ISP in the country, first IIS web server, first 56k dial-up access.. one of the first in N. America, first e-commerce site IN THE WORLD that displayed images of the products.. ) 

Having done alright in the sale, I had some free time. I had an idea for some software, but new very little programming (took a course in Basic in 1976), and I just couldn't get my head around C or the other main stream languages.

Then I read about Rebol.. there was something about it that I grokked right away, and that "the real technology, behind all the other technology, is language".
So I cut my programming teeth with the language. Simple things were indeed simple.

For that, I'm grateful for Rebol. It's earned me over $100,000 over the years (mostly early on).

But then I grew up. And regret the years I spent having anything to do with the language. Many of the reasons have been mentioned before, there's no new revelation as to why. 
But I'll reiterate my reasons in hope of sparing any aspiring developers from getting lost going down the path of rebolution.} "Yuri" "21-Aug-2010/3:46:39-7:00" {One thing I will mention up front. The reason I've hung around for 12 years is that Rebol is a great language. I think I've tried all of the more popular languages out there, and keep saying to myself "Rebol does this better, easier." 

ie: Parse is a mistress.. at first, but once you learn.. and I mean learn, regular expressions, then Parse isn't quite a pretty.. it's still prettier, but you find regex just about <i>everywhere</i> else.

And therein is the main problem... 

<b>1) Rebol is not mainstream.</b> It's a backwater.. an 'also ran' in this horse race of software development.} "Yuri" "21-Aug-2010/3:59:38-7:00" {<b>LESSON 1</b> If you want a hobby, pick Rebol. If you want a career, don't.

Rebol is Carl's hobby. It's one of those hobbies that, if done properly, can earn some money. Like bee-keeping or owning a vineyard.
} "Yuri" "21-Aug-2010/4:14:13-7:00" {Yuri, 

Your point of view is appreciated, but like most things, popularity has little to do with value.  The forces that drive the popularity of programming tools aren't entirely related to quality of language design.  Like you said, "Rebol is a great language" and it does many things "better, easier".  REBOL's marketing was handled badly - there's no question about that.  Unfortunately, when it comes to development platforms, commercial software developers need to use the tools that are popular, if they want to get a JOB developing software.  I've always told others to learn the mainstream tools if they want to get a job in the industry.

For my needs, REBOL has always been a perfect mix of functionality and ease of use.  I enjoy using it, and I've always been able to <i>complete more commercial projects</i> using it, than anything else.  REBOL is not right for everyone, and that's fine with me.  I've used REBOL for many years as a tool to enable business and personal computing.  I've made more money with it than you have, so it's been more valuable to me than it has for you.  Along the way, I've been grateful for REBOL's design - it's suited my needs perfectly :)  Read my response to you about REBOL being only a hobbyist's tool in "Does Anyone Know The Status Of Rebol 3".  In my experience, that hasn't been the case.} "Nick" "21-Aug-2010/10:16:45-7:00" {Nick in response to the post above, and the other, I submit for your approval the next point;

<b>2)The Rebol Community is too small</b>

This has a number of drawbacks, first and foremost is <b>lack of reusable code</b>

Software development is a very time consuming enterprise. If it's commercial, then the time it takes affects the bottom line. As an employee, that may be a good thing, but as contractor or employer, it's a major issue. Even if Rebol is a hobby, only the zealots don't mind wasting time debugging code all day.

In nearly every case where I've turned to Rebol for a quick solution to a problem, I've found none. And yet, I've been able to turn to other languages and not only <i>find</i> a solution, but incorporate it within minutes.

<i>In Rebol, if you're looking for a solution, the odds are <i>very</i> great you'll need to build it yourself..from scratch.</i>

Way too much emphasis within the Rebol community (and Rebol Technology) has been on the language itself. Because Rebol is a academic study in language more than a solution to real world problems. 

<i>The majority of the Rebol community is only interested in the academia.. they love to debate things like "Pairs as floating points, yes or no?" .. (from a recent post.  http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0326.html)</i>

<b>LESSON 2</b> Code re-usability is the developers friend. The larger the community, the more likely you'll find a quick solution.

Lack of community has other serious drawbacks.. } "Yuri" "21-Aug-2010/12:35:50-7:00" {Nick, I couldn't agree more*.  In just one function (parse), you get one of the most useful features of any language anywhere.  It's a killer app unto itself.  Using any other language to solve the problems that parse has solved for me is just masochism.

Yuri, AltME (Rebol 3 world) is not some secret club - it is open for anyone to join: http://www.rebol.org/aga-join.r - it's as accessible as R/View.  Stop by, leave a message!

* except the graphic design part, which isn't necessarily as binary as yourself and Yuri make it out - I'm sure Yuri makes pretty sites, but it's not clear at all that he understands your sites.} "Chris" "21-Aug-2010/12:48:13-7:00" {Missed Yuri's second post: so what if parse isn't mainstream - it's still pretty f'ing useful.} "Chris" "21-Aug-2010/12:51:04-7:00" {Yuri,

Yes, the REBOL community is small, but it's friendly and capable, and I've never had problems getting answers to any of my questions.  The number of people involved and the amount of donated code is REBOL's biggest drawback and my biggest potential worry for the future, but it hasn't been a problem yet for me, in over a decade.  And for the types of applications I write in REBOL, I don't expect that it will be.

Your second point is actually really interesting from my point of view.  In my experience, REBOL's productivity benefits have always enabled me to write software from scratch faster than I could cobble things together from others' existing code, using other development languages/environments.  That's actually what keeps me using REBOL to build all my custom applications.  It's just so fast and productive to build complete working applications from scratch.  For me, the proof is in the number and variety of computing tasks I've actually been able to accomplish with it - those which have affected real life activities.  I'm not interested in academia.} "Nick" "21-Aug-2010/12:56:51-7:00" {interesting debate going on here! 

I wouldn't say <i> "Rebol community is only interested in the academia." </i> If they were, they would have <b> never </B> allowed global variables/methods/functions, that could be accessed,  and changed by other objects/functions/scripts that are totally unrelated. 

in any comp science course, you are taught, there should be encapsulation for hiding the internal states or process of an object/or program in general, from the external world.

just like in VB they allowed GOTO, which is a "sin" according to academia (Dijkstra)

in a object oriented / non object oriented language i.e procedural or functional, you should  still be able to use private, local, static, public,  global  in an object/method/class/ or function/procedure/module/program.

} "yuem " "21-Aug-2010/13:35:26-7:00" {correction to my previous post:-

any language whether it's  an object oriented / or non object oriented language (i.e procedural or functional), should allow programmers to use private, local, static, public, global in an object/method/class/ or function/procedure/module/program , to do proper encapsulation. } "yuem" "21-Aug-2010/13:48:53-7:00" {Yuri,

You can point out benefits and shortcomings of any language/development platform.  C or Assembly can be used to write device drivers and other close to the metal software ... but you won't see web sites created using assembly, for obvious reasons.  PHP is popular for web development because it was created to solve development problems in that domain ... but it's not useful for creating embedded software.  Java has its merits just for having an enormous API and millions of developers who all use the same tools ... but that doesn't stop much of the industry from using VB, C#, Python, Ruby, etc.  Should all development in every problem domain be limited to Java, forever now, just because it's popular?  I used Flash for a multiplatform videoconference app, because the tools I needed for that project were built into the platform, there was existing code available for me to use and tweak, and the entire package, including Adobe's video server software, was the best solution I could find for my needs.  In that problem domain, Flash is better than REBOL, so that's what I used for that project.  I <i>could</i> have used REBOL, but in that case, it wasn't the most practical solution.

The scope of REBOL's usefulness and it's productivity benefits, compared to the tradeoffs that I've considerd for using it, have made REBOL the best choice for me over and over again in many situations.  In the past 6 years, for just about every computing task which I couldn't use a existing piece of software, REBOL has provided the tools I've needed to develop a perfect solution for my situation.  I have never once regretted learning and using REBOL.  It's been the most valuable and useful tool I've had to satisfy the overwhelming majority of my business and personal computing needs, repeatedly for many years.  I'm listening to your perspective about REBOL's value, but for every negative you mention, there's obviously been a benefit for me which has been more valuable.  I'm a user who's grateful for the benefits of REBOL, and I'd like to share that with others.  Trying do discourage new users from even trying REBOL doesn't do anyone any good, at least not anyone who could potentially be in my position, who could potentially benefit from it the way I have (I'm sure there are many out there, because my computing needs have been somewhere within the range of typical mainstream life).  If you'd like to see the REBOL community grow, and for REBOL to improve in one of the few ways that would be beneficial, then spreading that attitude doesn't help.} "Nick" "21-Aug-2010/17:26:39-7:00" {Nick, the proof is in the pudding. Pick a situation that Rebol <i>doesn't</i> handle now (there's plenty), and we'll compare notes.} "Yuri" "22-Aug-2010/1:59:39-7:00" {Let's look at one example of how community size affects developers..
<b>Nodejs vs Cheyenne</b>

- Nodejs is less than a year old, but the response has been overwhelming.. 

Here's a list of Nodejs modules to date
http://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules} "Yuri" "22-Aug-2010/13:03:14-7:00" {Yuri,

It looks like Nodejs is a fantastic marketing and technical success, and RT could probably do well to study how they went about achieving such great popularity.

A quick look through those modules is impressive - lots of work has been accomplished, no doubt.  But I can't help looking from my own perspective, which is that the majority of what's been accomplished there is just a huge amount of unnecessary complexity that I simply bypass by building applications in REBOL.  Just about everything in that collection represents solutions to problems that only exist as a result of stringing together layers upon layers of divergent technologies to accomplish <i>simple fundamental computing goals</i>.  Connecting different languages, data formats, etc. is complex work, but those tools only help to realize one fundamental goal - the creation of computing applications which manage <i>data</i> for human beings.  When I create my applications, I move straight to the end goal.  I've got GUI, network, graphics, math, parsing, compression, CGI, OS Shell, email, crypto, sound, database, image manipulation, etc., all built into REBOL, and working together natively to fully satisfy and achieve all the <i>fundamental computing <strong>goals</strong></i> that drive productivity in my real world.  I don't need all the frameworks, middleware, package management modules, etc. that have taken millions of development hours from poor souls who are trying to devise reasons to become relevant in the development industry.  Is <i>having</i> to spend my time learning those hundreds of Nodejs modules supposed to be a <i>benefit</i> to me?  From my point of view, so little of productive value has changed in the past 10-15 years in computing.  The ability to input, save, transfer, manipulate, and view <i>useful</i> data hasn't been improved much beyond what I can do natively with REBOL.  Yes there are shinier GUI interfaces, pervasive multimedia formats, and improvements in areas such as 3D graphics which are outside the scope of my interests in REBOL (mostly related to <i>entertainment</i>, aesthetics, etc. - topics which <i>don't improve productivity</i>).  But when it comes to building applications that let me get data from a user, store, sort, organize, transfer, and view it, on a single user machine, on a network, on the web, etc., I don't need anything but the most basic stack of technology (hardware, operating system, network connection, web server, etc.), and I can build the applications I need, quickly and easily, with REBOL.  The overwhelming majority of complex work displayed on that page is simply irrelevant to me.  I use REBOL to create the applications I need, from scratch, with only my end goals in mind.  I'm not lost in a huge mess of disparate technologies, waiting for others to create modules to help tie everything together.  I'm just productive, writing REBOL code that works to satisfy my real world computing needs.  In that grand perspective, there's nothing I'm left wanting for with REBOL.  The long and short of it is that all those other tools, as complex as they are, have never proven to be as productive as REBOL is for my needs.  That's the proof in the pudding I'm looking for.  If others can benefit the way I have, then I'm happy to share how and why :)} "Nick" "22-Aug-2010/16:36:38-7:00" {Here's a recent example.

I don't agree with this. .NET has a huge complexity, has thousands of classes, any experienced programmers cannot say how to do something without looking a document.

Here is a real example. One of our customers (which is one of the biggest banks in my country) needed an application and we were in a hurry. I made the program using C# go to customer's place, run the app. then it gives an error, "no .net framework 3.5". Oh no! they have 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 but no 3.5!
So we downloaded the framework (237 MB) installed, restarted the PC (which is a huge server!), after restart it required updates, downloaded automatically ~60MB, 3 different files, and restarted the server again (which was a really big problem!).
Now there is .net 4.0, 4.5 etc.. 

"At this point, REBOL is regarded as a utility language used primarily by programmers for in-house scripting."

Currently many of us use Rebol kind of this way, so it has some right.

Here is a real world example I made using Rebol plugin (it's in turkish & runs on IE):

<i>THEN</i> you need to map that DLL into Rebol. Having worked with libraries and Rebol in the past, this can be very cumbersome.. depending on the lib.

You disregarded my link to the open source project - and 2 additional seconds typing "open source data matrix dll" into Google found this project at sourceforge:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/datamatrix-dll/

Another 1 minute with Google, and I found this:  http://re-bol.com/datamatrix.zip .  On the site where I found it, that version is listed as freeware (it does have a nag screen, but that doesn't matter if running as CGI).  I did a little more research on this DLL, and the current version has commercial licenses, with support, starting at $98.  You can make your choice between open source and commercial (if, for example, you want support, or if a client refuses to use open source tools).

So far, nothing that you're complaining about with REBOL is as difficult or limiting as you describe.  I <i>have</i> used a number of DLLs for cases where the native REBOL API didn't satisfy my needs.  I've found that most DLLs which can be used in VB are trivial to convert to REBOL - just a <i>few minutes</i> of work.  And if I <i>couldn't</i> use REBOL for part of a project, or if it was impractical, then I could integrate another tool - that's not difficult, and I have no prejudice against other languages/tool sets.  As I explained, I was happy to find a great video conference solution available in Flash, but I still used REBOL CGI for the rest of the site, as a practical choice.  I've used Purebasic in the past to create DLLs and executables that I called from REBOL (Purbasic's OS API integration is fantastic and easy to use, it builds small, fast executables, cross platform, etc.).  AGAIN, <i>you're missing my point</i>.  I use REBOL for an enormous scope of work, because the native cross-platform API does contain <i>so much</i> of what I need to complete the overwhelming scope of custom computing work I find myself needing to accomplish, for which there aren't packaged applications.  I use it when I can, because <i>for that overwhelming majority of work</i>, it's more productive and enjoyable to use than other tools.  If I need to get something done which can't be accomplished with REBOL, then I use another tool.  If that's not the case for the majority of your work, then you should use a tool that fits your needs more appropriately.  My point is that REBOL has been VERY capable at satisfying my commercial and personal development needs, in virtually every case.  And because it's sooo much more productive than other tools, I actually get many more projects completed.  To me, that's been the main benefit of using REBOL.  Do you some sort of problem with that?} "Nick" "23-Aug-2010/15:17:25-7:00" {Yeah, I have a problem with that..

"At this point, REBOL is regarded as a utility language used primarily by programmers for in-house scripting." 

you lost me there, where did you get these 2 lines   from ? I am searching from the top of this page, but cannot find these two lines.

-------------------------------------------------

generally speaking, there is some truth about the point of "reusable component". just for the sake of discussion,  if I need a data table, I can reuse Henrik's data table or dobeash data table.  the more people we have in the community, the more reusable components we have. the smaller the community, the less components are available. 

I am referring to reusable components/scriptlets versus using layers & layers of frameworks/technology in coming up with a solution or the use of multiple languages for a solution e.g CSS, AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, XML + a main language like Java or .Net or PHP.  that's too much to cobble together.

and also generally speaking, the smaller the community, the slower the language takes to mature.
for example there is no web framework in rebol.  we have to use embedded rebol code and logic in html. and this is not a good separation of concerns ,  viz  MVC approach.

on the other hand, you can see the hell that Java developers have to go through, they have to use  java fx, java, servlet,  jsp, java fx and jsf, and a lot of times have to use a lot of other frameworks, like spring, struts, wicket, tapestry, ejb etc... just to come up with a solution. this is an overkill.

in the end, everyone has to make one's own decision whether to use Rebol or not. One should not try to discourage other people to not use it.

<b>LESSON 3</b> Small communities consist primarily of fans.

In a community of special interest (like Rebol),  as it begins to dwindle, all that's left are the die-hards. The fanboys. They have a vested interest in the technology.

Ego seems to play a large part, and there's more of a 'boys club' mentality. In a larger community, pockets of interest diverge. A smaller community forces these into a single group. Criticism of the technology, or anything else that doesn't fit in the club's ideals) becomes unacceptable.

Have a cool idea using Rebol for a project that will benefit the entire community, but need some help developing it? 
Consider yourself fortunate if you can find a single person with any interest at all.

The entire Rebol community is made up of, at best, 100 'fans'.

Even if you build it, there's few who need it, or would use it.

Cheyenne is considered one of Rebol's success stories, but how many Cheyenne servers are in productive use? Judging by the feedback, my guess is fewer than 10, and likely fewer than 5.

I am sorry, you are coming across as a loser and a  very bitter and disillusioned person, who is blaming a language for all your failures.

"Preventing young developers from making mistakes is a good thing. "

who do you think you are?  the saviour of the world ? I bet not.   Most likely a megalomaniac ...
you sounds very presumptuous to me. I would say it's definitely a bad thing to think young developers  are as dumb as you. 

what makes you think young developers don't know how to use their own mind to make their own decisions?  young developers today are a lot smarter than you are, and I can speak for them as well,  being 22 years old myself.

No young developer is  that  dumb, and they won't need any advice from someone as stupid as you. The language doesn't control us, we decide if and how to use the language to our own advantage.


Mr Yuri Andropov,... only people in communist countries brainwash their youths or their population.  Here in the west, people are allowed to think for themselves.

I must disclose , I don't have any agenda here .  Java and C# are my main  languages. .   one or two times  I  have used Rebol ( its one liners) , only if  they fit my need and I also use ruby and python from time to time.

you are displaying a pattern of behaviour that helps understand your utmost bitterness towards Rebol.  you are also showing a habit of pontificating,  without knowing what you are doing  or talking about.

"every religion has its zealots"   .... every atheist too is a zealot in that they 100% believe in  no deities, no compromise.

with all the knowledge you have about the "fanboys" "clique" , and the hatred you have for the language and community, and despite feeling miserable within the community , you are still here after 12 years? or does it take you 12 years to have your epiphany ? you  sound more like a masochist.
even the average Joe  won't be spending 12 years to figure this out 

if you find a language and its community are not worth it, you still stick around for 12 years !!!!. you have to blame yourself for that.  only stupid people do stick that long even if they are now wanted that long within a community.


besides.... all you comments you are posting have already been mentioned  many times by different people, who didn't take 12 years to figure this out.  
You are just going around searching for comments on the web and then sticking those comments in your posts here pretending it's yours, that's why it's taking you days to post every lesson learned.... ... maybe you will need 12 years to post your lessons learned.

When Rebol first came out, it was leading edge. - 

- "Runs on over 30 platforms"

- "Additional key features of the REBOL language include its compact size (150k on Windows)"

These were important in 1998, the net was young. A massive 5GB hard drive was $400. In 1998 the term "Open Source Software" was first coined. Proprietary was the name of the game.

While Rebol chugged along, the IT world raced past. 

Rebol 2 is considered "never finished" by some gurus (For the record, I've always found Rebol itself perfectly fine as is, and rarely, if ever found a bug.)

Rebol 3 development has been ongoing for what, 5 years?! If that isn't lumbering, what is?

While these years of effort have gone into the still incomplete language, the rest has languished.

There's more examples of "lumbering dinosaur" syndrome, please feel free to post your own.

"All non-Free software is a dead end."

It's not about money, it's about freedom. (Ok, and money too)

As an ISP in 1994, I had nearly a 1000 customers willing to pay me $1/hour to surf the net on 14.4 and 28.8 dial-up modems. But as the competition grew, internet access became more and more of a commodity. Clients fled to "unlimited" dial-up for $20/month.. then even less.

12 years ago it was possible to get away with charging outrageous fees (by today's standards) for what is essentially a tool.

I paid Rebol Tech over $1000.00 for an unlimited command license for one of my products, only to have that product no longer supported months later. Great. (Don't get me wrong, I did ok.. as I mentioned, I've earned over $100K using Rebol.. did you hear that youngDeveloper?)

<i>However</i>, those days are looong gone. Rebol has way too much competition now. 

RT <i>still</i> charges $149.00 USD for /command.. with it's ODBC and Encryption... 

Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. I can't iterate enough how absurd that makes the company look. (see "lumbering dinosaur above").

Until RT.. well lets just say it.. Until Carl wakes up, Rebol is doomed to perpetual obscurity.

Not true.  Look at MS, SAP, and now Oracle.Java.  SAP with its proprietary ABAP is still going strong, and now is a stronger since new, younger, guys came in to SAP.  It has adapted over the years and it still changing.

Look at the iphone.  It's the app, not what it was coded in that the user uses.

However I will agree that being more "open source" would have the potential of making it grow, if just for the name 'open-source'.

Encryption and ODBC <strong>are</strong> available in the current free version of REBOL.} "Nick" "26-Aug-2010/12:12:06-7:00" {Yuri,

I think many of your points would be more critically important if people had to choose only one tool to use, and then never had the option to use anything else.  But that's never what any developer does.  For example, if you need to create a desktop solution for your datamatrix situation, then your PHP solution is no longer viable - or at least, it's much more cumbersome to implement - so you'd likely just use another tool that makes the most sense.  That doesn't detract from the usefulness of PHP in its domain.  REBOL has its values, and like I've said, I agree that it's important for newbies to have a full perspective about its benefits and drawbacks, so I think this is a valuable discussion, and appreciate your point of view.  It's good to see things from every angle.  My angle is that the time I've spent with REBOL has been fantastically productive, enjoyable, and worth while.} "Nick" "26-Aug-2010/12:41:03-7:00" {"Encryption and ODBC are available in the current free version of REBOL."

100 years from now, I'm sure every development tool we currently use will be history.  But in the here and now, we've got what we've got.  MS, SAP, and Oracle.Java - you just dismissed a huge percentage of the current driving forces in computing, just because <i>some day</i> they'll reach the end of their life cycle?  That makes me feel a whole lot better about your attempts to discredit REBOL.  For many projects to come, for many years I suspect, for as long as I'm processing text data, using graphic UIs, serving files with Apache web server, etc., REBOL will continue to be as useful for me as it is today.  There's a strong likelihood that REBOL will eventually become just a part of history, like MS, SAP, and Java, etc., but I'm gonna continue to use it until something comes along which satisfies my needs better, for the things I do every day with REBOL, now.} "Nick" "26-Aug-2010/22:24:08-7:00" {Unless there's some drastic change, Rebol is already a dead end.

It's what the corporate world uses that mainly determines how long a language is around. billions of dollars were spent in the technology, and they can't stop , or convert everything just because yuri said so.  It's going to need billions of dollars to convert them to whatever the new languages are.

small businesses may use new languages, their applications are very tiny compared to those used in big corporate organizations, so it's a lot simpler to convert.

at the end of the day, we as IT workers, decide what languages we want to learn and use. No one can force me to use a language I don't want to use. 





} "yuem" "5-Sep-2010/1:18:11-7:00" {"I used Flash for a multiplatform videoconference app, because the tools I needed for that project were built into the platform, there was existing code available for me to use and tweak, and the entire package, including Adobe's video server software, was the best solution I could find for my needs. In that problem domain, Flash is better than REBOL, so that's what I used for that project. I could have used REBOL, but in that case, it wasn't the most practical solution"

"It took me just a few minutes with nothing more than search/replace and copy/paste in a text editor to convert the VB API in the above zip file, to REBOL"

"I've found that most DLLs which can be used in VB are trivial to convert to REBOL - just a few minutes of work. And if I couldn't use REBOL for part of a project, or if it was impractical, then I could integrate another tool - that's not difficult, and I have no prejudice against other languages/tool sets. As I explained, I was happy to find a great video conference solution available in Flash"

its odd that you would use flash as in the codec, the scripting language and/or the video codec container ?

 i cant seem to find a single rebol ffmpeg/x264 wrapper to any video encoder DLL to date libx264 etc, whereas there appear to be many VB to ffmpeg/x264 wrappers see 
http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=vb++x264+wrapper&btnG=Search&hl=en&sa=2

it would be a very good thing if someone that knows rebol would spend these few minutes you describe and make a current rebol wrapper to 
these DLL's and provide a basic script to parse an input directory, open each video file found there  and do a simple x264 encode.

the API DLL equivalent of ffmpeg.exe -i 1080P.mkv -flags +global_header -vcodec libx264 -crf 21 -acodec aac -ac 2 -ab 192000 -strict experimental -vpre hq -vpre veryfast -refs 3 -threads 4 output3.mp4  

using a current nightly from http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/autobuilds/
 for instance and any 1080P mkv videoyou might have laying around.

i must say though , you choosing flash in whatever capacity your using it over using an quality ffmpeg/x264 AVC.H.264 high profile encode to do your realtime transcoding video chat etc plus rebol to feed the video chat windows is really surprising TODAY. } "ffmpeg" "13-Sep-2010/8:02:57-7:00" {does chrome work here  with the current captcha

the simple solution is to make and place ll the .ffpreset files in 
C:\usr\local\share\ffmpeg\ if your running the ffmpeg from somewhere on C: or if your running ffmpeg from a subdir on f: then make and place a copy of them in 
F:\usr\local\share\ffmpeg\ etc also, its not a problem as their really small text files that x264 will use to produce its output, you can also set a env variable instead but iv never found out the right one and this placing the ffpreset files on each partition you might use for encoding seems simpler.


if your a masochist you can also replace the vpre with fpre and use absolute paths and full whatever.ffpreset you want to use on the line lol.

for your rt video chat encoding tests you could also try setting the fastest encode it has 
-vpre ultrafast but -vpre veryfast usually great for reasonable speed dual/quad x86 desktop PCs today even if you set only 1 thread for ffmpeg to use.

as a side note, the -strict experimental is requires so you can use the current internal AAC codec -acodec aac -ac 2 to re-code your audio

Many people do many things with many other things. We have all heard the truism, "when the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail".

I am coming to programming late in life but bring a lifetime of experience to the process. I know that you should pick up the very best and most robust tools you can find because often you will stay with them for a very long time. The time spent selecting them is never wasted.

I have a friend who is starting this journey with me. We both agree on the goals, the methodology and the time line. An expert is the sum of 5 years of effort variously expressed as 20,000 examples or 10,000 hrs. That's what it takes to master the basics and rise to competency in a new field of endeavor.

We have chosen a functional language approach hiving off into newLISP and picolisp. My friend chose newLISP for various reasons and launched himself into creation and a web application paired with sqlite using this "scripting" dialect of LISP that came with all sorts of modern builtins.

I am still trying to start, I'm sure everyone here has been there too. So because I am not able to 'dive' in I am going wide. I'm looking at languages, structures and methods. I'm collecting a vast store of commentary and discussion. The history of LISP makes interesting reading.

The proponents make a good case, the detractors of course point to various other examples, which isn't hard, considering the estimated 8500 languages that have come and gone or stayed or floundered or niche'd. 

The bottom line however is that it is still all 1's and 0's. I keep repeating that to myself during all the debate and proselytizing. 

I read Siebel's 'Coders at Work' and Biancuzzi's 'Masterminds of Programming' which created a lot of extra perspective as to what the debate is all about.

REBOL is everything Yuri says but it is also everything Nick and everyone else says as well. I know all of these arguments. I've lived them since 1985 because that is when I made a choice between one OS and another, one architecture over another and one path versus another.

I had been saving for a computer and the Apple Lisa seemed a dream come true. Then the Mac came out but somehow it seemed wrong. The money I had put aside disappeared for life expenses and the decision was delayed. 

One day I was walking along a main street and I chanced upon another computer store I had never visited. Inside the door an Amiga 1000 sat with three boxes on a screen and in each of the boxes what appeared to be a program was running, add that to the screen they sat open on I simply stood there with my mouth open. There was a paradigm shift in my understanding of the world at that moment.

As the years passed by I found the flaws in that Mac, Byte magazine ads were declaring Lotus 123 on the PC ran in 256K whilst the Mac offered a meagre 128K non-expandable memory. PC's of the day beeped and flickered whilst the Amiga flowed and multi-tasked for a decade unchallenged.

So now we get to the heart of why REBOL looks so much more interesting than the alternatives. History for one. Sassenrath sat down and created "intuition" behind a closed door as a single act of genius. That act made the Amiga a force of change in the world. It speaks to me like Graham's story of ViaWeb written in LISP and what it allowed him to do to his competitors.

Despite all the arguments one way or the other - a good tool remains a good tool.} "terry" "3-Oct-2010/13:28:14-7:00" {Terry,

I was lucky enough to have parents who exposed me to some really unusual, exciting and interesting music as a child.  Because of those performances, I eventually started a career as a musician, playing classical guitar.  I had a natural interest in the music that I heard classical musicians performing back then - there was just so much depth and excitement in those performances.  I cut my teeth, developed my technique, built my fundamental musical skills, and began my career by learning and performing classical pieces.  As a professional, now I perform mostly mainstream music (rock, country, pop, blues, jazz, etc.).  I rarely have a reason to play solo classical guitar any more, but after 32 years learning and performing music, and 25 years in the business (more than 3000 performances), I occasionally get a chance to perform some of the music which originally sparked my desire to become a musician.  Those pieces are truly works of art, timeless and valuable for the creative vision and intuitive musical excitement/energy they embody.  Those pieces are still a commercially valuable part of my repertoire, and they will always be a huge part of the foundation of my musical skill.  Not only do I NOT regret learning those pieces and spending time seriously studying classical music - I have a great appreciation for having gone through the process of learning that music with so much passion.  It helped form me.

I began programming BASIC on an early Tandy computer when I was 7 years old.  I had the typical lineup of popular machines through the years:  TRS-80, TI99-4a, Commodore 64, the original Macintosh, all the versions of DOS and Windows from the original 4.7Mhz IBM PC xt through 286, 386, 486, Pentiums, etc...  I programmed my first graphics in assembly code, and I began learning C before the first ANSI standard was published.  I studied CS in college, at an interesting time and place where LISP was the language of choice and the university network ran on VMS.  I created commercial applications in the first version of Visual Basic (for DOS), installed business systems on the first versions of MS Windows, hacked together a web site content management system in PERL before Internet access was common place, and dabbled with PHP/MySQL before there were any commercially available books to learn from.  I used MS Access to create database systems that have been running successful businesses for more than 15 years.  I wrote my first book - part of the curriculum for IU music school - on a 286 that ran on floppies.  My first instructional guitar videos (VHS tapes) were edited on a video toaster (an Amiga based machine).  I owned a retail computer business for more than a decade, where I built computing systems on every OS imaginable (remember Netware?).  Not only do I NOT regret having learned all those computing environments and tools - I have a great appreciation for having gone through the process of learning them, for the practical and creative values they embodied at the time.  They helped form me.

I first came across REBOL more than a decade ago, and it's been an indispensable tool in my life for 6+ years.  REBOL has been at least as useful and important to me as HTML, inexpensive web hosting and broadband Internet access, netbooks and wireless networking, cell phones, etc...  It made sense to me and was productive from the very beginning, and it regularly satisfied my development needs through a variety of large and small projects.  It has been a very <i>practical</i> choice for me.

I'm sure that whatever tool you choose to learn programming will only be the first in a long journey - just part of the foundation of your eventual experiences.  Pick one that makes sense to you now and which <i>demonstrates some practical potential</i> for your immediate and near future needs.  Then keep your mind open and be prepared to change directions as technology moves forward... :)} "Nick" "4-Oct-2010/10:06:45-7:00" {Carl did not write Intuition.  It was written by RJ Mical.

"for example there is no web framework in rebol. we have to use embedded rebol code and logic in html. and this is not a good separation of concerns , viz MVC approach."

Since nobody has picked up on this, I'll mention that REBOL has several web frameworks, including a rather nice MVC one, called QuarterMaster:

http://www.ross-gill.com/QM/} "Kaj" "8-Oct-2010/11:26:14-7:00" {kaj,

the page states:-
QuarterMaster is still at early stage of development and that was in 2007. 

Is it stll alive?  Is there no further development since 2007?
} "yuem" "8-Oct-2010/23:20:59-7:00" {That the quide was written in 2007 doesn't mean that the last program version is from 2007. The last change I know about is from a few months ago.

Rather, it means that QuarterMaster has a nice dialected interface, which has the effect that you can work on the implementation without changing much of the dialect, or the guide.

Here's QM's ongoing work:
http://jira.rebolsource.net:8080/browse/QM

QM is also the default web framework in the Syllable Server operating system, and supported there in combination with the Cheyenne web server.} "Kaj" "9-Oct-2010/12:43:52-7:00" {thanks for the information Kaj.

just wondering why the link to this framework is not on the Rebol site. 

any other web frameworks links that you could let us have here ?

} "yuem" "11-Oct-2010/9:40:20-7:00" {Yeah, QM is remarkably unknown.

The other frameworks are either old (Magic!, Vanilla) or mainly for static websites. Of course, there's also still the web app/RSP API included in Cheyenne. The most notable static framework is Remark, because it is moving towards a dynamic engine:

http://www.pointillistic.com/open-REBOL/moa/steel/retools/remark/index.html

However, the newer rewrites don't seem to be published yet.

I have an extensive framework of my own that is in heavy development and that I don't intend to publish in full, at least not soon, but I use it to run a number of sites.

So QuarterMaster is the fullest offer. There are usage and development sections about it in the Syllable Server manual:

http://web.syllable.org/Server/README-SyllableServer.txt} "Kaj" "11-Oct-2010/10:14:19-7:00" {Well...is it a case of blaming one's tools...?

A success?  It is.  Are others more popular? 
Marketing? Or mainstream vs the road less traveled.

Stand out and be different and get nailed.
} "bk" "18-Nov-2010/20:36:27-8:00" {Actually Yuri has a point.  His original complaint was he can't get a job as a REBOL developer.  Try to get one just knowing Ruby, Python, or Groovy and you'll starve too.

Now how to get the large corporations to start building and using applications in REBOL would be a more productive line of thought.

I code in ABAP. I can work for any corporation that uses SAP.  It is not open source, and it'll be one of my main languages until I retire.  But it's not sexy.

There are many languages that never make it to mainstream.  Perhaps REBOL is one of them.  Only time will tell.

  
} "Steve Oldner" "22-Nov-2010/14:13:25-8:00" {Getting the large corporations to start building and using applications in REBOL is impossible until REBOL is backed by a large entity. That could be either a large company or an open source community. Both are unlikely.} "Kaj" "23-Nov-2010/14:59-8:00" {Actually, I think that if there was a port of REBOL that targeted the JVM, you would have a relatively easy time getting corporations that have standardized on Java to allow its use. There is more and more acceptance of languages such as Scala and Clojure, which compile to Java bytecode and have full interoperability with existing Java code.

Lots of Java developers have discovered the benefits of languages that offer functional programming features, conciseness and expressiveness and, where it makes sense, are introducing these into their workflow. } "Adrian" "29-Nov-2010/9:17:01-8:00" {The problem with that is that a REBOL compiling to bytecode would not be a port, but a complete rewrite. The current rewrite to REBOL 3 has taken half a decade, so...

The best that might be done would be a port of REBOL 3 that would interface tightly with the JVM. But that would still require you to install an extra executable, so it would still be the same obstacle.} "Kaj" "29-Nov-2010/10:56:07-8:00" {Come to think of it, it would be possible to build a REBOL 3 executable that would include one of the open source implementations of Java with a license that doesn't conflict with REBOL. So you could disguise REBOL very well, but you would have to require people to install your version of the JVM.} "Kaj" "29-Nov-2010/11:02:13-8:00" {There is another possibility for REBOL-Java interop which I mentioned some time ago on AltME. When you're talking about corporate development using Java, deployment typically done on application servers such as WebLogic, WebSphere, Glassfish, etc. Most of these big names have changed their low level infrastructure to be based on OSGi - a modularization framework that provides for dynamically updatable, versionable code bundles which provide services at the JVM level. 

These bundles are basically zip archives containing Java class files, resources and and native dll's that might be needed along with some metadata that describes the services provided by the bundle. REBOL could be provided as such a bundle and could upon loading, provide proxy Java services to interact with other services in the JVM or with services in local or remote JVMs using the remote OSGi spec (socket level connectivity). These Java classes could be generated by the REBOL bundle on demand and added to the JVM at runtime as additional bundles, or they could be pre-generated and deployed with the REBOL bundle.

I removed "Probe" and the console window does not show, good. It works but just one thing it must do is if I manually type in another word in the f5 field, then select a new drop down I want that new word also to appear in the f5 field. As of now, any word like "--level" that is added to the f5 field is erased when you select a new drop down number.} "Tony" "12-Jan-2012/12:31:44-8:00" {Yes "Probe" is like Print, it writes any value (except unset!) to Console window mainly for debugging purposes.
It is useful because it "returns" the value that it wrote.
try these examples on Console window:

>> probe 3 * 5
15
== 15
>> 3 * probe 5
5
== 15

>> x: 5 reduce [x]
== [5]
>> x: 5 reduce probe [x]
[x]
== [5]
>> x: 5 probe reduce probe [x]
[x] ;first probe (on the right side)
[5] ;second probe (on the left side)
== [5]
>> probe x: 5 probe reduce probe [x]
5    ;first probe left most
[x]  ;second probe, right most
[5]  ;third probe, in the middle
== [5] ;probe returns the last value

} "Endo" "13-Jan-2012/8:35:33-8:00" {For your second question, "overwritting the F5 text":

it is because, if you SET a new value to a variable (word) it always overwrites the older value.

If you don't want this, you should CHANGE the value instead of SETting it.

Here is what I mean, try it on Console:

>> x: "test"   ;think that this is F5/text
>> y: x
>> print [x y]
test test ;x and y "points" to same value (same string, same memory position)

>> x: "hello"
== "hello"
>> print [x y]
hello test

x changed, but y does not. we created a new value and SET x to it. So x and y have totally different values now.

Here is the second example:
>> x: "test"   ;think that this is F5/text
>> y: x
>> print [x y]
test test ;ok

>> clear x
>> print [x y]
    ;they both cleared
>> append x "hello"
>> print [x y]
hello hello

Here we did not re-set the value of x, we just changed it. we did not overwrite.

I advice you to practice on Series Values (read about them on Core.pdf) and Series functions like CHANGE, APPEND, INSERT, FIND, CLEAR etc.

I hope this will give you the idea about your problem.

set-face function sets (creates) a new value, does not change the original one.
} "Endo" "13-Jan-2012/8:49:34-8:00" {Thanks Endo. In my case I do want a new value to go into the variable "x264comline" and that's what I thought that "x264comline: to-block f5/text]" would do. How come it doesn't? This command is supposed to look at what's in f5/text and save it as variable x264comline including what else I have typed in the f5 field manually but it doesn't. What am I missing?} "tony" "13-Jan-2012/9:57:47-8:00" {First, you type something into the field (f5), f5/text holds what you've typed.
But then, when you click on drop-list you set f5/text to something else.
Look,
set-face f5 mold/only replace x264comline select x264comline '--crf value
this line changes the f5/text, so you lost what you've manually typed.

here is your code:
    across 
    label "Select crf:" crf1: drop-down 100 data [20 18 19 21 25] [set-face f5 mold/only replace x264comline select x264comline '--crf value x264comline: to-block f5/text f5/text] 
    return 

chage it to:
    across 
    label "Select crf:" crf1: drop-down 100 data [20 18 19 21 25] [set-face f5 mold/only replace x264comline select x264comline '--crf value x264comline: to-block f5/text f5/text]
    btn "Show" [probe f5/text]
    return

then type something on f5 field, and press the button (don't select anything from drop-list)
now you'll see the text that you manually typed.

But there is one more thing that you should think about it:
if you write something that is cannot convertable to a block, you get an error on "to-block f5/text"

try typing this on the field: 3*
this cannot be convertable to a block because it is not a correct REBOL value.

>> to-block "3*"
** Syntax Error: Invalid integer -- 3*

so you need to check if there is an error:
x: either error? try [t: to-block f5/text] [copy "error!"] [t]

As I mentioned, "(edited quickly, so please check for errors)".  I just did a rough edit so that you could see the code pattern changes required, but haven't proofed or executed the code on the server.  I'm working 100+ hours a week, so haven't had much time to provide community support.

Whenever I get an error of that sort with CGI scripts, I check my server's error log.  The error returned by REBOL, for the CGI script, will be visible there.  If I missed a parenthesis or forgot to close a block in the script, you'll get the required feedback from the error log.  For CGI scripting, I keep a direct bookmark to my error log - it helps find and fix those problems immediately.

I did notice that I receive a "Premature end of script headers" error if I edit the script using the cPanel file manager text editor (maybe something having to do with text encoding?).

The way I work with CGI scripts is to edit them on my desktop PC with Metapad, and upload the edited script.  That way I'm always sure the file format, encoding, etc. is always the same, plus I've always got the most recent version, and an archive of the entire history of the script revisions on my flash drive (which I sync to several backup drives daily).

The built in REBOL editor works nicely too for editing CGI scripts.  } "Nick" "15-Jan-2012/13:49:19-8:00"][{Redirect a windows command line program to a GUI field} {Is is possible to do the above.

It would mean saving the output of the command line program to disk and poll on that file once in a while, by opening a port to the file and copy from it. This would run in a loop with a small WAIT to avoid too much CPU usage.
